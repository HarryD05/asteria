Introduction</h2>\n<p>Recent advances in medicine have led to the development of numerous devices that aid the detection of eye conditions such as glaucoma, macular degeneration and cataracts which are amongst the causes of reduced vision or even irreversible blindness. With age as the largest risk factor for most of the aforementioned conditions, screening the elderly at higher risk has become a common practice in the UK, allowing early detection and thus reducing complications or blindness.</p>\n<p>As mentioned by Glaucoma UK [1], glaucoma is the leading cause of blindness affecting over 700, 000 people in the UK of all ages. It is a chronic, neurodegenerative disease and is defined as the loss of retinal ganglion cells in the optic nerve of the eye, resulting in progressive loss of peripheral vision. The damage to the optic nerve head is due to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) as a result of unevenness between the production of aqueous humour (transparent fluid located in the eye) and the drainage system of the eye.</p>\n<h2>2. Development of Glaucoma</h2>\n<p>The aqueous humour, as shown in Figure 1, provides nutrients to the eye and maintains the eye pressure. It is produced by the ciliary body and flows to the anterior chamber where it is drained at the drainage angle. The reference of ‘angle’ is the angle between the cornea and iris. Amongst the various structures of the drainage angle, the most essential structure in the drainage of aqueous humour is the trabecular meshwork which is a spongy tissue with a sieve-like structure.</p>\n<p>Figure 1 – Taken From Medirex Opticians [8]\r\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 334px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/4a7471acc640016624b789bb3d1e426c/86d36/Healthyeye.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 43.50000000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Healthy eye\"\n        title=\"Healthy eye\"\n        src=\"/static/4a7471acc640016624b789bb3d1e426c/86d36/Healthyeye.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/4a7471acc640016624b789bb3d1e426c/772e8/Healthyeye.png 200w,\n/static/4a7471acc640016624b789bb3d1e426c/86d36/Healthyeye.png 334w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 334px) 100vw, 334px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Following fluid drainage from the eye via the trabecular meshwork, the fluid flows through a structure called the Schlemm’s canal, into collector channels, veins and then eventually, back into the body’s circulatory system [3].</p>\n<p>A blockage in the drainage system restricts the flow of aqueous humour into the anterior chamber, resulting in increased pressure in the eye and eventually damaging the optic nerve. The optic nerve (also known as second cranial nerve) found at the back of the eye transfers visual information from the retina to the brain via electrical impulses [2]. The high pressure caused by inefficient drainage compresses the second cranial nerve resulting in cell death – this is called Glaucomatous optic atrophy.

If an individual has XFS, fibre-like substances existing outside of cells are deposited on ocular structures and throughout the body. The exact reason for XFS is unknown and hence, the mystery surrounding it means that the ultimate cause of glaucoma is still to be concluded.</p>\n<h2>3. Classifications of Glaucoma</h2>\n<p>There are several types of glaucoma, some include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Juvenile/adult Primary open-angle glaucoma</li>\n<li>Acute-angle closure glaucoma</li>\n<li>Secondary glaucoma</li>\n<li>Congenital glaucoma</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The most common type of glaucoma is primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). Anyone can develop POAG but there are some risk factors that may make individuals more susceptible to it. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Age\n<ul>\n<li>According to Glaucoma UK [6], it is estimated that about 2% of people aged 40+ have POAG, and this rises to almost 10% in people older than 75 (Glaucoma UK, n.d.).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ethnicity\n<ul>\n<li>Individuals with an African – Caribbean origin are at a higher risk of developing POAG compared to an individual with a European origin</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Family History\n<ul>\n<li>If your parents or sibling suffer from glaucoma, you are at a higher risk of developing POAG</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Myopia</li>\n<li>Corneal thickness</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Like most types of glaucoma, fluid is unable to be drained which leads to an increased eye pressure, damaging the second cranial nerve. Nevertheless, in POAG, a subgroup known as normal tension glaucoma (NTG), where the eye pressure is not very high, still damages the second cranial nerve. This may also be referred to as low tension glaucoma. Unlike most eye diseases, glaucoma does not show symptoms in early stages as there is no pain or drastic change in vision since the damage occurs in the peripheral parts of the vision.</p>\n<p>As mentioned, glaucoma left undetected can lead to devastating consequences such as irreversible blindness. So how can glaucoma be detected?</p>\n<h2>4. Detection of Glaucoma</h2>\n<p>After years of research and developments, there are now several modern computer-based machines that can be used to detect early signs of glaucoma. Some include the optical coherence tomography (OCT) machine and the fundoscopy machine.</p>\n<p>The OCT machine is a high-resolution imaging modality producing a cross-sectional tomographic (3-dimensional) image of the retina and evaluates the optic nerve. The use of long-wavelength and broad-bandwidth light sources to illuminate the retina enables it to assess the light reflected from the retinal tissues through the use of a spectrometer [4]. Additionally, it can indicate small changes in the thickness of the nerve fibre layers which gives early signs of glaucoma. Other than glaucoma, the OCT machine can also detect age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic macular oedema (DME), central serous chorioretinopathy (CSR) and many more diseases. A low image quality can often be caused by cataracts due to the blockage of light.</p>\n<p>In addition to the OCT machine, a fundoscopy machine can also be used to detect glaucoma. Like the OCT machine, it is a modern medical imaging technique that enables optometrists or ophthalmologists to detect changes in the optic disc and hence, glaucoma.</p>\n<p>Figure 3 – Fundoscopy Pictures From Hindawi Journal Comparing Optic Disc Without and With Glaucoma [5]\r\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 449px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/a296acf1cfae2ecb6b2de426bc02765c/93dc1/Fundoscopy.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 55.49999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Fundoscopy\"\n        title=\"Fundoscopy\"\n        src=\"/static/a296acf1cfae2ecb6b2de426bc02765c/93dc1/Fundoscopy.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/a296acf1cfae2ecb6b2de426bc02765c/e07e9/Fundoscopy.jpg 200w,\n/static/a296acf1cfae2ecb6b2de426bc02765c/066f9/Fundoscopy.jpg 400w,\n/static/a296acf1cfae2ecb6b2de426bc02765c/93dc1/Fundoscopy.jpg 449w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h2>5. Treatment of Glaucoma</h2>\n<p>Although there are no available treatments to regain vision that has been lost, eye drops such as betaxolol hydrochloride (Betoptic S) and metipranolol (Optipranolol) have been made available to those suffering from glaucoma. These are beta blockers which reduces the production of fluid released from the eye. Prostaglandins such as latanoprost (Xalatan) are other forms of eye drops that improve the drainage of the fluid in the eye to reduce ocular hypertension. Other forms of treatments include laser procedures and surgery. Nevertheless, there is still room for further developments of treatments such as gene therapies to prevent more prevalent ocular diseases such as POAG and its eventual testing in humans. Despite ongoing research on how gene therapies may prevent POAG, Luxturna, a form of gene therapy, has been known to treat congenital blindness (another classification of glaucoma) which is a seminal accomplishment.</p>\n<h2>6. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Having said that, it is important to remember that these non-invasive treatments do not cure glaucoma, but instead it controls the intraocular pressure in the eye and prevents damage to the optic nerve. Hence it is vital to regularly attend eye check-ups, especially with a family history of glaucoma or other eye conditions.</p>\n<p>Don’t forget: Prevention is better than cure. </p>\n<h2>7.

Probing further into the last two, 3D techniques were often used to simulate a large movement or environment, e.g. the wildebeest stampede scene in The Lion King, whilst the entire Tarzan jungle was created in 3D with a hand drawn Tarzan swinging through. The pioneering computer animation software they used at the time for this effect was Deep Canvas.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 193px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/05b12bbe16f61696716b946ab4bd4c01/fe066/Tarzan.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 107.25388601036269%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Tarzan\"\n        title=\"Tarzan\"\n        src=\"/static/05b12bbe16f61696716b946ab4bd4c01/fe066/Tarzan.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/05b12bbe16f61696716b946ab4bd4c01/fe066/Tarzan.jpg 193w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 193px) 100vw, 193px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>In fact, the Oscar-nominated Apple TV film “Wolf-walkers” (2020) used 3D models and VR to create a CGI forest much like Tarzan. However, the animators took this one step further and recreated each scene by hand, using graphite on thousands of sheets of paper - to mimic art from the 1600s. Ultimately, 2.5D serves as an in-between medium to make use of the best of both worlds. “The idea was that it would not feel too clinical, too clean, too artificial,” says Eimhin McNamara, an animator at Cartoon Saloon - which produced Wolf-walkers. He also shares that “it helps you feel like you're actually in the head of the character.” To help with the time-consuming process, they played with the frame rate - dropping it down from 24 fps (frames-per-second) to 12 fps, meaning they drew 12 images for every second. Still a very painstaking task if you ask me!</p>\n<p>Talking more about the video games side of things, pseudo 3D games first came about in arcades in the mid-1970s. ‘Interceptor’, a combat flight simulator game by Taito, was supposedly the first arcade game to make use of 2.5D with its “eight-way directional movement, shooting down enemy planes, and depth perception by size-changing enemy planes.” Moving further in time, we find more titles such as Donkey Kong Country, which features 3D characters and backgrounds, but with restricted 2D plane movement - ending up as a 2.5D game.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 178px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/9ac6dd60ce6fbfefddb12c39279d83a1/15408/Interceptor.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 95.50561797752809%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAATABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwABAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIDBf/EABcBAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgP/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAebGjJwoGYeeQq//xAAZEAEBAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgASMTP/2gAIAQEAAQUCpOgp3FYhMzbmd5b9N//EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABIg/9oACAEDAQE/ATH/xAAWEQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEBH/2gAIAQIBAT8BK//EACAQAAIBAQkAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEQIgISIxMkJhcZH/2gAIAQEABj8CapMjSyVf0Ym45Nvtj//EABsQAQADAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESExYVGR/9oACAEBAAE/IQUFPMnNT5UVbk8fq2kQw+9SxyfCs2C0P2PZ/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABDLJwL/xAAZEQADAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGhIVH/2gAIAQMBAT8QtdYr48K8Ef/EABwRAAIABwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARARAxQYHw8f/aAAgBAgEBPxBwdRt6XxL/xAAfEAEAAgEEAwEAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhMVFxgUFhkbH/2gAIAQEAAT8QMbOD5XppLJQKKq2LA49yjsA3Sjg6no6HI2iWVlaY/lQDYQxxcLICpnaLLB8n/9k='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Interceptor\"\n        title=\"Interceptor\"\n        src=\"/static/9ac6dd60ce6fbfefddb12c39279d83a1/15408/Interceptor.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/9ac6dd60ce6fbfefddb12c39279d83a1/15408/Interceptor.jpg 178w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 178px) 100vw, 178px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>There is however, a key difference between 2.5D used in games and in films. In video games, this technique is used more often by playing with perspectives. An isometric view, such as the one depicted on the right, gives the illusion of 2D characters being shown as 3D. Nevertheless, like Donkey Kong Country, the side-scrolling 2D plane movement makes games like these in 2.5D perspective. The reason for using this technique was initially to do with limitations of the hardware systems - e.g. generating full 3D games required a lot more power than a NES could provide at the time. Nowadays, much like with films, it’s a choice made for the realism and in-depth, immersive feel you get from a 3D-style.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 201px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/28b78dd01755cd8d96a2e8912f221ae9/e0b5a/Donkeykong.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 114.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Donkeykong\"\n        title=\"Donkeykong\"\n        src=\"/static/28b78dd01755cd8d96a2e8912f221ae9/e0b5a/Donkeykong.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/28b78dd01755cd8d96a2e8912f221ae9/e07e9/Donkeykong.jpg 200w,\n/static/28b78dd01755cd8d96a2e8912f221ae9/e0b5a/Donkeykong.jpg 201w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 201px) 100vw, 201px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>In conclusion, 2.5D is a relatively generic term that describes a combination of animation styles used in making films and video games or an illusion of 2D and 3D. In fact, most of the entertainment that you usually consume is in fact in 2.5D - you just didn’t know it! Keep an eye out for it next time you watch a Netflix movie thinking it’s entirely either 2D or 3D, looks can be deceiving…</p>\n<h2>Bibliography:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.insider.com/how-wolfwalkers-used-3d-tech-to-transform-25d-animation-2021-2#:~:text=But%20many%20films%20actually%20fall,a%20unique%20hand%2Ddrawn%20style\">https://www.insider.com/how-wolfwalkers-used-3d-tech-to-transform-25d-animation-2021-2#:~:text=But%20many%20films%20actually%20fall,a%20unique%20hand%2Ddrawn%20style</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mangaplanet.com/what-is-25d/\">https://mangaplanet.com/what-is-25d/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bullfrag.com/what-are-2-5d-games-and-how-do-they-work/\">https://www.bullfrag.com/what-are-2-5d-games-and-how-do-they-work/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-2-5d-games-2d-3d/\">https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-2-5d-games-2d-3d/</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"type":"Article","first_name":null,"surname":null,"school":null,"pronouns":null,"role":null,"slug":"/articles/41ffd4a9-7d96-4931-9061-a42a69bb992a","profile_picture":null,"title":"Ever heard of 2.5D?","subject":"376B70","userID":"7da338a3-5756-4ac9-a269-cd8cfef6f23a","articleID":"41ffd4a9-7d96-4931-9061-a42a69bb992a","preview_image":"drawing.png","video_url":null,"issue":1}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>Since 2014, with all factors being equal, the annual inflation growth rate on the transfer market for the top 5 league footballers has been 26%.

For most large clubs, match day sales are mostly fixed with little fluctuation since they sell out most to all their stadium. On the other hand, the other 3 factors are massively dependent on the success of the team and their overall popularity. Sponsorships tend to also be driven by the reputation and success, where more notable and prestigious teams land higher value sponsorships; Liverpool FC’s deal with their defining sponsor Standard Chartered, a British bank, is rumoured to be worth around $59.2 million a year2. Commercial sales are a weird mix of popularity and success, for example Man United have recently been underperforming largely but have no doubt been constantly selling shirts and tickets due to strong fan loyalty. TV revenue is also determined by several ways differing by league/tournament, the Premier League for example determines the final allocation of TV money by league position, how many games were shown by the team and also by the pool of money generated from selling the rights domestically and overseas.</p>\n<p>Overall, 3 of these income streams can be maximised by having the best possible team and players. Franchise players can significantly help considering that many of these players come from countries with a large domestic market or fanbase; in 2019 Juventus signed Ronaldo for a fee of approximately £105 million, but his shirt sales alone reportedly earnt around $60 million in just the first 24 hours3 on top of the huge digital impact shown by the graph, proving how significant the ROI was associated with this transfer. It would be fair to expect the value of these franchise players to increase even further as more developing countries begin to participate more as global consumers of the games.</p>\n<p>Another reason that accelerated increases in the value of transfers is due to a crazy transfer involving Neymar Jr, a Brazilian Prodigy. This all stems back to 2013, with Neymar joining Barcelona from Brazilian club Santos for a substantial but well reasonable fee of £49m4. Barcelona set his release clause at €222 million, which at the time seemed more than enough to put off any rational sporting investors, but PSG are not a rational club and in 2017 decided to break the transfer record by signing Neymar for this absurd fee. This sent the market for high tier football players into a vigorous spiral, with the first domino effects being seen in Spain where €1bn release clauses in renewed contracts have started to become more common with the top 4 teams. Desperate to replace Neymar with this huge sum of cash, Barcelona’s first mistake was to purchase Ousmane Dembele for €105 million from Dortmund where he was injury plagued and only scored 19 goals in 102 games. Disappointed with his performance, and also needing to replace Iniesta, Barcelona spent a further £120 million on Coutinho from Liverpool who performed even worse and ended up being loaned out. Within 6 months, all the money that Barcelona had received was gone, both players signed did not live up to expectations, causing it to anger fans and lead to substantially less revenue being generated compared to what was expected, whilst causing every other decent attacker’s value to be inflated by a huge margin, such as Joao Felix for £114 million and Jack Grealish for £110 million. There was also a surge in the number of free transfers; as more and more players were denied transfers to new clubs due to ridiculous valuations, many just started running down the time on their contracts and leaving like Pogba with Manchester United, Rudiger and Alaba with Real Madrid and Messi with PSG.</p>\n<p>In general, it has been much more common to see higher than ever price tags being slapped onto even the most mediocre of talents, but this is not surprising in a highly competitive industry with highly profit maximising clubs that will take every opportunity to squeeze money out of their rivals and fans. With more clubs seeing the potential of franchise players to help their finances and the fall of an old generation of players, there is even more demand for new football superstars for young fans to idolise, support and financially contribute towards as they grow up.</p>\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://football-observatory.com/IMG/sites/mr/mr47/en/\">https://football-observatory.com/IMG/sites/mr/mr47/en/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/liverpool-standard-chartered-shirt-sponsorship-extension-premier-league/\">https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/liverpool-standard-chartered-shirt-sponsorship-extension-premier-league/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/18/juventus-sold-over-60-million-of-ronaldo-jerseys-in-just-one-day.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/18/juventus-sold-over-60-million-of-ronaldo-jerseys-in-just-one-day.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22760770\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22760770</a></li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"type":"Article","first_name":null,"surname":null,"school":null,"pronouns":null,"role":null,"slug":"/articles/c9110dba-0ed1-4a05-b21d-1aec152bb5b9","profile_picture":null,"title":"The Economics behind football player prices","subject":"BFAA34","userID":"157ed3ad-a5b3-41cd-88d3-7dd3c9b4e15b","articleID":"c9110dba-0ed1-4a05-b21d-1aec152bb5b9","preview_image":"economics1.jpg","video_url":null,"issue":1}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>Microeconomics is the study of decision making, and the interaction of producers, consumers and the government in markets. Bits and pieces of economic theory have been mentioned by the Ancient Greeks but in the late 1700s, modern economics came into existence as its own subject, gaining lots of traction until it became one of the most important social sciences in use today.</p>\n<p>Neoclassical economics is, broadly speaking, the theory that focuses on demand and supply; the most important determinants of the production, consumption and market price of goods and services. This was revolutionary, as in the 1900s, it changed many economists’ views and influenced classical theory, where costs of production was the most important factor for the market price of goods and services, among other ideas. Nowadays, when we think of economics, our brain goes straight to supply and demand, demonstrating the impact that Neoclassical economics has had on our views. But it’s not only just our views, but our real world actions; our implementation of policy and how we run our businesses. But the Neoclassical theory has been around for a relatively long time from the birth of economics, and makes many assumptions, some of which aren’t completely in line with our world today. This creates some problems when trying to implement this theory; And that’s where Behavioural economics comes in.</p>\n<p>Neoclassical economists believe in economic rationality. In theory, consumers always maximise their utility, or firms aim to maximise their long term profit, but there’s so much more to it. When it came to how and why consumers make decisions, Neoclassical economics came up with a few principles, which together make up rational choice.</p>\n<p>One axiom of this theory is that consumers process the information of an economic decision objectively and are not subject to framing manipulation, having fixed preferences.</p>\n<p>Another assumption is that consumer preferences are complete, which means that the consumer will have a preference, and when presented with two goods will be able to say which they like better, or will be completely indifferent. They will not be undecided or get confused on which one to buy, they will either pick one, the other, or neither, and not for the sake of it.</p>\n<p>The third, and possibly most famous, idea of rational choice is the Substitution axiom. It argues that if a consumer has no preference between two goods, then the consumer would be indifferent between two lotteries with those two goods as their prizes. Now this axiom further states that if something identical is removed from those two goods, the consumers would still have the same preference between them; known as the cancellation principle.</p>\n<p>Neoclassical economics has so many rules and principles regarding consumer choice and rationality, and after describing a few of them one may question how Behavioural economics ties into any of this. Well, Behavioural economics revolves around the fact that consumers are not rational, and how they can potentially be manipulated into making certain decisions - decisions that consumers think they are making all on their own.</p>\n<p>As with most parts of economics, Behavioural economics can be traced back to Adam Smith in the 1700s, who knew that people are overconfident and often overestimate their abilities, which are concepts that can be found in Behavioural economics today. However, it was much later, in the 1980s, when this came into fruition. Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman were very active psychologists during this time, identifying key concepts of Behavioural economics, and setting the foundation for future economists to build upon. Most famously, they found that people are subject to framing manipulations, with a theory they called “Prospect theory”.</p>\n<p>For example, most would choose to win £250 guaranteed rather than gamble on a 25% chance of winning £1000 and a 75% chance of winning nothing. However, if presented with the chance to lose £750 guaranteed or a 75% chance to lose £1000 and a 25% chance to lose nothing, most people will risk losing £1000, hoping to lose nothing. What this shows is that people are more likely to take on the risk when trying to avoid a loss rather than gain a profit, which contradicts utility theory.</p>\n<p>In the 1980s, Richard Thaler began collaborating with Tversky and Kahneman, and further built upon this work. It was around this period of time where Behavioural economics is said to have properly been created, and Thaler was credited with being its founder, later earning him a Nobel prize in Economic Sciences in 2017. Thaler built the base of Behavioural economics, most famously writing a book in 2008 about the concept of a “nudge”. This concept of a nudge, a way to influence the behaviour of an individual, is now synonymous with Behavioural economics, and it’s all thanks to Thaler.</p>\n<p>Looking at real life examples we can see why neoclassical theories may be wrong when it comes to rationality, and Behavioural economics can, to some extent, explain why people do what they do. But Behavioural economics can also be used to help solve market failure. Market failure is where the market doesn’t deliver an efficient allocation of resources; goods are being over/under produced. This is against neoclassical theory as it is stated that markets will reach allocative efficiency, through the power of the “invisible hand”, and when market failure occurs regulation is typically the answer. However, as with any economic decision, there are opportunity costs, for example for the regulation to be effective monitoring and policing is needed. Additionally, bans could lead to illegal activity and regulation could also reduce consumer choice. And this is where the concept of the “nudge” becomes very useful.</p>\n<p>In Thalers’ book he sets up a scene of a school cafeteria, and Carolyn, the director for food services, is trying to influence the decisions that the children make, without using typical measures like banning specific foods or likewise. She found that by placing certain foods at eye level, or making separate queues for desserts and main meals, she could increase or decrease the consumption of many food items by up to 25%. These simple small changes can be used to reduce market failure to a certain extent, and with potentially smaller opportunity costs.</p>\n<p>However, while this may be used to reduce market failure it can also be used to achieve the opposite. Firms use many ideas of Behavioural economics when making decisions. For example, the concept of the default choice is continually used. Research shows that humans rarely deviate from the default choice, the option that is selected if the consumer selects nothing. Even if people are aware of a change to the default settings or can choose between the default option and another options, many people choose to stick with the default. This is exploited by firms, as if they find any one policy or such gives a better outcome for them, they will simply make it the default.</p>\n<p>Another example of how firms use loss aversion to sell is quite commonly found on online shopping sites. Loss aversion is the idea that people dislike losing more than they enjoy winning, meaning they would choose much lower risk options, even if it means drastically reducing the reward, and this can be seen in the Prospect theory example we covered earlier. Shopping sites use phrases like “There’s only one left”, “Limited stock” or “Selling out quickly”, creating a sense of urgency and also fear of missing out. Loss aversion can also apply to social norms, and people trying to not lose in the sense of fitting in. If items are appearing to sell out quickly the risks of not buying are seemingly more than the risk of buying, rushing people to the checkout.</p>\n<p>Looking at Behavioural economics on a surface level, it may seem like the solution to all of neoclassicals problems in microeconomics, as it stems from the fact that people don’t always make choices in their best interests, which is entirely what neoclassical theory is based on. However, the rise of Behavioural economics, while having solved problems, has also created problems. It is as writer and philosopher Robert Pirsig says: “every answer leads to ten more questions”. With the discovery of nudges and choice architecture, how the environment of the decision can be used to influence the decision, we realise that all of our decisions, whether intended or not, were made with us being nudged in some direction. And with that we realise that it is impossible to not influence peoples’ decisions, and that there is no such thing as a neutral layout, because it is still a layout.</p>\n<p>Finally, Behavioural economics is still a relatively new concept, and while 2008 may seem like a long time ago, there is still further to go until Behavioural economics will be able to make as much of an impact as neoclassical economics. Additionally, schools of thought such as Keynesian and neuro-economics have helped to make our understanding and practice of economics more informed. Our world is extremely complex, with there being so much that we don’t understand. Behavioural economics models should be used as a tool, alongside Neoclassical and Keynesian models, to help us make some sense of how our economy works, and what we should do to improve it.</p>\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Beggs, Jodi., ThoughtCo. 2022.

Therefore, when I say, 'the science has told us not to eat McDonald's', what I mean is that 'multiple concordant studies in recent times have concluded that eating McDonald's out of moderation will result in long-term weight gain' [2].</p>\n<p>While that makes sense, it does include a quick sleight of hand on my part which is worth exploring. In the second statement, I assumed that the implicit objective of the first was to maintain good health. The phrase 'Should I eat McDonald's?' by itself has no aim contained within it, so technically speaking, we can't answer.</p>\n<p>While it holds colloquially, even if I had asked, 'Should I eat McDonald's to avoid gaining weight?', it's still difficult to reply in a yes or no fashion. A rigorous answer would take into account genetic factors; the other parts of your diet and lifestyle, specifically how much McDonald's; and so on to ultimately determine whether you would gain weight.</p>\n<p>Therefore, every time we use the word 'should', it's necessary that we supply an objective – i.e., a larger aim within which the action I 'should' or 'shouldn't' take lies – and that we supply the necessary context that would apply to the question.</p>\n<p>It's necessary to clarify that by saying '...how should we live?', I'm assuming that 'live' can be broken down into a series of more specific verbs. It's more productive to consider ‘how should we live?’ to mean how we should act in a finite and limited situation – and then assume that 'life' as a whole refers to a series of overlapping finite situations – rather than by trying to wrestle with fundamentally how we should live our entire lives start to finish in one go. We might end up there but it's not a useful place to start.</p>\n<p>It's also important to clarify why I'm able to use the phrase 'the science' so easily, and why I intend to for the rest of the essay. As mentioned, I'm interpreting 'science' to be a method that ensures objectivity and lack of error. Therefore, 'science', in any capacity, can refer to both the existing research of our time – i.e., currently published work on the health effects of McDonald's – as well as the hypothetical research we haven't taken yet – i.e., the implications of McDonald's that we're yet to discover. After all, both of which still fall under the domain of science, given that the correct method is used. Therefore, it's possible to say a phrase like, 'although science can't tell us how we should act right now, if we had the right technology and method, then it could'. And given that 'science' in this case refers simply to a universal method – to quote Carl Sagan [7], \"Science is more than a body of knowledge. It's a way of thinking, a way of sceptically interrogating the universe with a fine understanding of human fallibility,\" – we should be able to consider both existing science (research we have already taken) and potential science (research we either haven't done but could or research we will only have the means to do in the future) with equal merit.</p>\n<p>Back to McDonald's.</p>\n<p>Following our example, if I asked if eating a McDonald's takeaway (of specified caloric value and chemical makeup), providing the context of my diet and genetics and so on, would make me put on weight in the form of stored fat, it's reasonable to say that it's within the reach of science to answer that question. We either already have, or could obtain, the data to answer conclusively, yes or no. And we can reframe 'if I eat at McDonald's, I will gain weight' to fit into the context of the question by adding the modal verb 'should', as we discussed before. Therefore: 'If I want to maintain my weight, I should not eat at McDonald's'.</p>\n<p>As demonstrated, 'science' has told me how I should act in that situation. As such, when I supply an objective and obtain enough data, then yes, science can tell me how to live.</p>\n<h2>Part 2</h2>\n<p>You might argue that such a statement can't be concluded from a single handpicked example. And you're right. I specifically chose an example which involved an easily quantifiable value – whether the numerical value of fat in my body would increase after regular McDonald's consumption, or whether my daily processes would be sufficient to burn those calories off after each meal. When the aims and objectives we have – to pass a test with a certain score, to achieve an income above a certain value – the metric for success is black and white. It's in these cases that science can tell us how we should live with total certainty.</p>\n<p>This includes cases that aren't so obviously numerical. If my objective is for a ball in my hand to bounce, I can quantify this as whether the height of the ball post-bounce is of similar height to pre-bounce, at which point we can conclude that the ball 'bounced' (success). Any height lower than that, we can define as the ball having 'dropped' (failure). In this way, most isolated examples can be quantified, and by extension, used in a scientific context.</p>\n<p>Let's try, 'What should my favourite colour be?'. You might instinctively consider this to be a subjective and personal question, but I would argue that it too can be quantified. Current research suggests that the human eye perceives around a million different colours (since we have 3 types of cone cells each perceiving 100 shades) [3]. Let's give each colour a score from -100 to +100 based on how strongly my brain reacts to seeing that colour. For this, we can use a machine that detects levels of electrical activity in the brain.</p>\n<p>Since there are a finite number of colours, it's reasonable to assume that there will be a single colour, i.e. aquamarine, that reaches something like +99.82, beating out bright orange at +99.81, making it objectively my favourite colour. (There will be colours lower down with identical values, like a bell curve).</p>\n<p>There are two ways to interpret this information. It's true that, with a microscopic enough scale and the supremely rigorous scientific method, every example can be made into a quantifiable measure of success or failure. With the example of colour, a common objection is that there are an infinite number of colours, and so there should be a smaller subset of infinite colours all scoring +100, at which point science can't give me a single highest scoring colour; the scientific method has fallen short. But this objection fails because the human eye can only perceive a finite number of shades. The fact that our experiences are limited by our body means that at some point, all data is discrete data with a high enough resolution.</p>\n<p>But the second conclusion that I draw is more cautious. It reiterates that the assumption I took in the beginning that 'science' refers to both existing and hypothetical data is simply an assumption. While it's interesting to think that, at some level, science really could tell us how we should act in every isolated situation, the question asks 'Can science…?', not 'Will…?' or 'Could science…?'. As with every generation, our science of today is limited, so when we disregard the potential of the scientific method, there are cases where contemporary science just can't tell us how we should live. Moreover, just like how we used to believe that the universe was geocentric [4] or that cigarettes were beneficial to our health [5], there are cases today where we as a scientific community are wrong and don't know it yet. To me, this produces a more thought-provoking conclusion: for many of us, science does indeed inform the way we live, even when it is wrong.</p>\n<h2>Part 3</h2>\n<p>Things have been looking pretty favourable for science so far – it appears that in short, the answer to our question is simply 'yes; see terms and conditions'. And that's been true so far. And yet, hopefully, by the end of the essay, you'll begin to see the answer as a spectrum of many answers.</p>\n<p>Firstly, some clarity is required on what an 'isolated example' really is. I've used the term now and then to break down how we should 'live' into how we should 'act in this situation'. As I said, it's easier to grapple with. Specifically, I use it to refer to all of the actions that are taken to achieve a single objective. When my single objective was to ascertain my favourite colour, I undertook a series of actions, all of which I consider to be part of one isolated example.</p>\n<p>The difficulty comes when trying to ground these situations back into reality; going back from individual examples to 'living' as a whole. The difference is that when I have a singular objective in mind, there are a finite number of ways to achieve it, of which there is a single 'best' way to do so, i.e. most efficient and effective. I briefly mentioned an example of achieving above a certain score on a test. Either through existing scientific evidence [6] or by conducting new experiments and evaluating the data, we can determine the single most effective set of actions to take to achieve a particular score. Simultaneously, if I have responsibilities as a single parent to keep my child emotionally and physically healthy, given the nature of her genetics and lifestyle, and so on, there are a finite number of 'best' ways to achieve that, too.</p>\n<p>But what happens when I try to achieve them at the same time? Within the space of a day, let alone a year or a lifetime, each of us has hundreds of major to minute priorities that overlap simply by coexisting in my life at the same time. And the more objectives I have, the more potential outcomes there are that day for how things eventually turn out. Since I can't complete every objective to the same degree, the varying degrees of moderation to which I can achieve each task gives rise to an infinite number of possible outcomes, of which some are better than others. However, just like how increasing the number of colours I could choose from means that there will eventually be multiple colours that are equally scoring, there will necessarily be multiple 'best case' outcomes that just happen to prioritise different objectives over others.</p>\n<p>See, to say I should do something (to achieve an objective) implies that there is a single best way to go about it. If there are many equally viable actions I could take, there is no scientific imperative to choose one of them over the other, and as such, no single action I 'should' take. As such, the more equally viable actions that arise, the lesser the role of science is in determining which I should choose.</p>\n<p>This is why I think that our answer should be a spectrum rather than a clear yes or no answer. The fewer objectives we have at once, the greater the likelihood that there is one single best compromise that most effectively utilises our resources in achieving as many objectives to the greatest degree. However, as we juggle more and more objectives, the likelihood that there's more than one 'optimum' course of action determined by a scientific method increases. Simply put, the more colours we have to choose from, the greater the chance that ten, twelve or a thousand of them will all score 99.99. And out of that group, there's just no scientific method to choose the best colour; the utility of science decreases as the number of objectives you have increases.</p>\n<p>After all, to quote The Cincinnati Enquirer, 'The saying 'Life is just one damn thing after another,' is a gross understatement. The damn things overlap.'. Unfortunately, the more damn things you have, the less that science can help.</p>\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Dictionary.cambridge.org. 2022. science.

As of August 2022, Anime Planet lists over 205 anime as having the isekai tag; over 1877 manga as having the isekai tag; and novel updates lists over 2100 light, web or published novels as having at least one of the following tags: transported to another world; transported into a game world; reincarnated in another world; and reincarnated in a game world.  The origin of the isekai can be traced to the Japanese folk tale of Urashima Tarō, who saves a turtle and is brought into a magical undersea kingdom. After spending what he thinks is 4-5 days there, he returns to his home, only to find that 300 years have passed1. That is what an isekai is: it is speculative fiction (fiction that incorporates elements not grounded in reality, recorded history or our universe) in which one or more protagonists are transported (usually through being summoned or dying and then reincarnating) into another world. From there anything can happen as the very nature of the setting allows the author to do whatever they want.  The term isekai itself (meaning “other world” or “different world” in Japanese) was used sporadically until 20132, after which a substantial increase in searches can be observed (see fig 1).</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 624px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/9926b958d5e093a6ef35ebc84c73552a/39c09/trend.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 27.500000000000004%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAGCAYAAADDl76dAAAACXBIWXMAAA7DAAAOwwHHb6hkAAAAtElEQVQY05WQzW7DMAyD/f6v2MtO7YD1J3XiOpZIcbCTQzpghxL4AFqiZMMp56xSigCoKyI+psvM1FpT0q7/gp8uTiRFhnhocMfc5e46ZroHuS94J69QUm/8Rdtt+Tmp1vo+GBTchp8qB3mlzjN1ujalpUHFQsU4eFloXql7cT1e0FShn8UH/Xwrruvi+p6hr4frMmNkS4NIKJlDCAmMjZB6bTXIGQPDRtvr3ffs8dUExjf8AlKE2Tz0+PmPAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Google trend\"\n        title=\"Google trend\"\n        src=\"/static/9926b958d5e093a6ef35ebc84c73552a/39c09/trend.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/9926b958d5e093a6ef35ebc84c73552a/772e8/trend.png 200w,\n/static/9926b958d5e093a6ef35ebc84c73552a/e17e5/trend.png 400w,\n/static/9926b958d5e093a6ef35ebc84c73552a/39c09/trend.png 624w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span>\r\nFig 1.

Frequency of use in July 2022 is arbitrarily set to 100.3</p>\n<p>With isekais having such a specific set of boxes they have to tick to be classed as an isekai, it is not surprising that Azuma Hiroki’s grand nonnarrative can be applied and can also be commonly seen in all modern, mainstream isekai. Azuma’s grand nonnarrative suggests that there is no grand narrative but instead all stories consist of tropes and clichés from a canonical pool of such recognisable to the reader. This collection of tropes and clichés is the so-called grand nonnarrative4. It is blindingly evident how this applies to modern isekai. After all, they all feature one or more protagonists being transported one way or another to another world or setting; a lot of them receive new skills or “cheat abilities” (read legally distinct plot armour); and usually there is magic and monsters. More niche tropes include the “game system” (where the world the story takes place has a system similar to that of role-playing games that has a level up mechanic etc); the death-by-truck-leads-to-reincarnation, which has spawned the meme of “truck-kun”; and more fantastical elements like the adventurers’ guild or the summoned protagonist(s) being chosen hero(es) and whatnot. Dr Paul Price, in his essay “A Survey of Story Elements of Isekai Manga” asserts that these stories “have no higher meaning other than they are created with the elements and characteristics that come from the grand nonnarrative”. Whilst this can be seen to be true with <strong>a lot</strong> (and I mean the vast majority of isekais you read), it obviously does not apply to all isekai stories and there are some that subvert certain clichés and tropes to great effect but it then poses an interesting question: is it (the story) still part of the grand nonnarrative if it uses elements not part of the so-called canon? Or rather, if a subversion of an isekai trope (such as the protagonist being summoned to another world to be their saviour) is successful the first time (turns out the protagonist was mistakenly summoned alongside the saviour and is unwanted!) and then is copied ad nauseum by other prospective isekai stories, at what point does the subversion of the trope/cliché become one itself and become a part of the grand nonnarrative canon? Also, what even defines the canon of the grand nonnarrative? Is it merely just elements and characteristics of stories that are instantly recognisable to the reader? If so, isn’t everyone’s reading experience different?</p>\n<p>With such confusing queries, it does seem that the isekai genre itself can offer a solution, or rather, the start to one. After all, isekai by the very nature of its being and creation is recognisable. Does your story involve being transported to another world? Isekai. Does your story not involve being transported to another world? Not an isekai. But is that really all that makes up an isekai? No matter how many tropes you tack on to your story, without the crucial “character is transported to another world”, your story is not an isekai. So is that it? Is being transported to another world the only characteristic of an isekai story necessary for it to be called an isekai? Yes, it appears to be and that is why isekai is such a popular genre.</p>\n<p>The thing with isekai is that the otherworld can be whatever the author wants it to be. As such, you can tailor any other genre to also be an isekai. Do you want some magic in your slice of life romantic comedy? Boom, make it an isekai. Do you want your coming-of-age story to happen in an interesting setting and not Earth? Boom, make it an isekai. Do you want to exposit all the cool and exciting lore of your magical world but can’t think of a way to do it subtly and/or naturally? Boom, make it an isekai so your clueless, out-of-this-world (literally) protagonist acts as the perfect catalyst for any exposition dumps you want to do to slow down the plot! With so much variety and with how saturated the isekai genre is nowadays, there seems to be an isekai for every niche. Want to read about how a guy got reincarnated as a sentient sword and is wielded by a cute cat girl? There’s an isekai of that (Tensei Shitara Ken Deshita). Want to read about a guy got reincarnated as a vending machine and now travels with a cute girl? There’s an isekai of that (Jidouhanbaiki ni Umarekawatta Ore wa Meikyuu ni Samayou). Want to read about how a guy got reincarnated as a slime, makes friends with an ancient, powerful dragon and leads a village of goblins to creating a global superpower? There’s an isekai of that (Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken). Naturally, having so many isekai stories out there means that a whole lot of them are garbage and very few are good (and tasteful) pieces of literature.</p>\n<p>There are certain memes surrounding the isekai genre in popular culture. The aforementioned meme of “truck-kun” is perhaps the most prominent, caused by the trope of having your isekai protagonist reincarnate as a result of being run over by a truck - either because the driver was drunk or asleep at the wheel and unwittingly ran the unlucky (or lucky?) protagonist over or because our intrepid, heroic protagonist pushed some baby/child/teenage girl/ old lady out of the way of a truck whose driver was drunk or asleep at the wheel (wow, misandry much?). Another meme is the absurdly long title, prominent in mostly Japanese isekais (though not limited to just isekais, it seems to be a phenomenon affecting all genres), and acts more like a blurb than the title of a book. The most damning is perhaps the meme that all isekais are self-insert power fantasies of the author, characterised by an overpowered (male) protagonist with as much personality as soggy cardboard who inadvertently gains a harem of beautiful women in another world. This brings up a problem with the isekai genre in the modern age, an age where anyone with access to the internet realise their wildest fantasies onto the digital page and subject such horrors to any hapless netizen. The problem with isekai is also isekai’s greatest appeal and has been established previously in this article. It is the problem of the author being able to write whatever they want with a character that is innately somewhat relatable (after all, the character that is transported is our only link to the world we are familiar with so we feel a kinship with the character as the only remotely relatable thing in this new world). This leads to the trash of the isekai genre: the drivel perpetuated by incels, designed only to act as a way to hide their insecurities behind the generic face of the embodiment of their power fantasies. Let this not, however, distract from the truly wonderful stories that the isekai genre has to offer, who shine even brighter when compared to the relative trash littered across the internet.</p>\n<p>Similar to the grand nonnarrative proposed by Azuma, narrative consumption, as proposed by Ôtsuka Eiji, describes the act of reading smaller narratives not only for direct personal enjoyment but also as a way to access a larger, grand narrative. This grand narrative is the framework for smaller stories and is only accessed by the consumption of smaller narratives, hence narrative consumption.5 As I perceive it, the truly immersive, well-written isekais are ones that offer smaller narratives as a way to access the larger plot whilst also keeping to (or cleverly subverting) the characteristics and tropes of the grand nonnarrative. The blend of both allows the author to fully explore the world they have created without having all the exposition and lore dumped onto the main protagonist which slows down the plot. Having multiple narratives and viewpoints resolves that problem and furthermore, it develops the side characters alongside the main character as you get their thoughts and opinions on the various events of the story - it can also be used to progress the plot from another point of view or an interesting angle. That being said, isekais are written to revolve around the transported character and as such, they must be the focus of attention in most of the story otherwise the story may as well be a fantasy story without the added element of the transported character. The use of multiple narrative perspectives just allows deeper development of the world and the characters that inhabit the world rather than the reader only getting the narrative perspective of the main character, which limits the amount and also what sort of exposition or lore they can be exposed to. There are several great examples of this and each of them is a powerhouse in the isekai genre however, my favourite example is “So What If I’m a Spider, So What” (“Kumo Desu Ga, Nani Ka?”).</p>\n<p><strong>[MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD]</strong> This story subverts a lot of the common tropes of the isekai genre: the protagonist is killed in a mysterious explosion alongside her classmates and is reincarnated as a spider monster without any cheat abilities in a perilous situation (the bottom of a dangerous labyrinth, which actually adds stakes and tension to the story), thus subverting the tropes of being reincarnated as a human or humanoid and receiving some “cheat ability” to boost them ahead of their peers. Through various sidestories you are drip fed the events of the outside world through the perspective of her other classmates (also reincarnated but more in line with what is expected of an isekai) which succeeds in developing the plot and world of the story as a major motivation for one of the characters is to reunite the class which involves finding our protagonist who’s stuck in the most dangerous place on that world. Through the side characters the author, Okina Baba, also subverts the hero trope of isekais (where a transported character is the chosen hero who will save the world) by having the hero be an existence that is actively harmful to the survival of the world and ALSO offers an interesting spin on the perception of time in the story. By having the side character chapters appear so early in the novel, you, the reader, are let to believe that the events of both the side character and protagonist narratives are happening in tandem; however, it becomes subtly evident that they are not - the main events of the story (from the protagonist’s perspective) are happening a full decade before the events of the side character stories and acts as a satisfying payoff to the small details strewn about the earlier chapters that lead up to this revelation. It successfully blends both the grand narrative and the grand nonnarrative to achieve a story that clearly revolves around the core cast of transported characters whilst using the smaller narratives to fully establish all the key character motivations, backgrounds and lore of the world as well as drawing from the pool of isekai tropes to deliver a fresh take on the isekai genre and a unique story.</p>\n<p>The isekai genre is expansive and limitless in the stories it can tell. The worlds that are introduced can create such a feeling of wonder and desire to know more that it can suck you in, much like the protagonists of the stories themselves. It’s easy to get lost in the sea of isekais, in the characters and in the plot - something that the authors themselves seem to be victim to. After all, how many isekais have completed stories? It doesn’t seem like a lot of them do: 383 of the over 2100 web, light and published novels on novel updates are listed as completed and that’s just the translations of the original texts. Whilst isekai is mostly lighthearted genre consumed for mere pleasure, a bit of light reading to do when you’re bored, it is also a lesson in the dangers of burn out and capitalism. The isekai series “Overlord” (“Ōbārōdo”) has been discontinued due to the author, Kugane Maruyama, feeling burnt out after having written the series since 2012: a series that has seen 16 light novel volumes, 17 manga volumes and 4 anime seasons. Many a web novel isekai once given a manga series or anime or official publication as a light novel seems to be less interested in the overall story, the grand narrative, and more on making money. My beloved “Kumo Desu Ga, Nani Ka?” is a victim of this - the ending of the web novel was suspended whilst the author wrote the light novel (the official publication of the story) and whilst the anime was in production. When the ending was finally delivered, it was lacklustre to say the least. So whilst Dr Paul Price’s comment that these stories “have no higher meaning other than they are created with the elements and characteristics that come from the grand nonnarrative” can be held as true for the plot, perhaps they hold meaning as cautionary tales against burning out doing something you find passionate or forgoing good storytelling to make more money.</p>\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isekai\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isekai</a>  Accessed 19/08/2022</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Price, Paul. “A Survey of the Story Elements of Isekai Manga”.

At every row, the ball may fall on either side of that peg. The route that the ball takes and its final destination depend precisely on the starting conditions now. Mathematical chaos resembles an infinitely long peg-board. If there is any uncertainty at all about the starting position of the ball (and in any real world scenario there will definitely be at least some uncertainty), then the route of the ball remains unknown to us. Even the tiniest of changes will fundamentally change the course of the ball. This means that with the slightest of uncertainty, we will be totally oblivious of the outcome. This is what mathematicians call chaos.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 153px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/b70a12f9c8abad6e80a4f8e71181adc6/3bda9/pegboard.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 123.52941176470588%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Peg-board\"\n        title=\"Peg-board\"\n        src=\"/static/b70a12f9c8abad6e80a4f8e71181adc6/3bda9/pegboard.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/b70a12f9c8abad6e80a4f8e71181adc6/3bda9/pegboard.png 153w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 153px) 100vw, 153px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h2>The simplest chaotic system</h2>\n<p>Now we know what chaos is, we can start exploring some chaotic systems. Chaos can originate from the simplest things, and we will now be looking at the simplest chaotic system: the logistic map.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a fixed variable r, a variable x (that is between 0 and 1) and another variable (1-x). Now, we can form a simple sequence with x_{n+1} = x_n * (1-x_n) * r. Let’s first take r = 2 and x_0 = 0.25, meaning 1-x_0 = 0.75.\r\nx_1 = (2)<em>(0.1)</em>(0.9) = 0.18\r\nx_2 = (2)<em>(0.18)</em>(1-0.18) = 0.2952</p>\n<p>Next, you’ll get values of x_3 = 0.41611392, x_4 = 0.4859262512 (10dp), x_5 = 0.4996038592 (10dp), x_6 = 0.4999996861 (10dp). As you can see, the sequence is getting ever closer to 0.5, which is called the attracting point of the system. The starting value of 0.1 has no relation to the attracting point, as with any starting number between 0 and 1 will yield the same attracting point.</p>\n<p>What’s interesting however, is what happens when we change the value of r. If we change r to 3.1, keep the starting value as 0.1, and round of our results at 2dp, the sequence will go:</p>\n<p>0.1, 0.28, 0.62, 0.73, 0.61, 0.73, 0.60, 0.74, 0.59, 0.75, 0.59, 0.75, 0.58, 0.76, 0.57, 0.76, 0.57, 0.76, 0.56, 0.76, 0.56, 0.76, 0.56, 0.76, 0.56.</p>\n<p>This time, the sequence doesn’t tend to 1 value but rather fluctuates between 2, namely 0.76 and 0.56. This is called an attracting 2-cycle.</p>\n<p>When r = 3.5, we get an attracting 4-cycle between 0.50, 0.87, 0.38 and 0.83.</p>\n<p>We can figure out new values of r where we find attracting 8-cycles or 16-cycles, etc. This is called a sequence of bifurcations. Once r exceeds approximately 3.56995, something new happens. Taking r = 3.57 will give us the sequence 0.1, 0.32, 0.78, 0.62, 0.84, 0.47, 0.89, 0.35, 0.81, 0.54, 0.89, 0.36, etc.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to think that if you let the sequence run on for long enough, eventually, a pattern will emerge, but it will in fact not. This is the core of mathematical chaos. No matter how long the program runs for, the sequence just jumps around seemingly randomly. Furthermore, even if we change the starting value by microscopic amounts, the new sequence will look completely different to the original.</p>\n<h2>Chaos in real life</h2>\n<p>The (arguable) founder of chaos theory is Edward Norton Lorenz, a mathematician and meteorologist, who, in 1961, used a simple digital computer to simulate weather patterns. This simulation was modelled by 12 variables, such as temperature and wind speed. He wanted to see a certain sequence of data again so, to save time, he started the simulation in the middle of its course by entering a printout of data that corresponded to conditions in the middle of the original simulation. What was surprising was that the predictions made by the machine were completely different from the previous calculation. The reason for this was due to the printout containing rounded values. The computer itself worked with a 6-digit precision (0.991231), while the printed values contained 3-digit values (0.991). The difference is minuscule and the consensus at the time was that there should be no difference practically. Lorenz has just discovered that small changes in initial conditions produce large changes in long-term outcome.</p>\n<p>This means that as the resolution of weather readings increases, the predictions of future weather will change drastically. In 1969, Lorenz described the butterfly effect which entails that even the tiniest factor has a significant impact on an outcome, such as a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil being the cause of a tornado a few weeks later in Texas.</p>\n<p>Let’s take another field now, such as astronomy. In space, bodies, such as planets and stars, orbit around each other under the mutual attraction of gravity.</p>\n<p>When there are just 2 bodies, their paths of orbit are extremely simple to calculate. Planets orbit stars in ellipses. Stars can be locked in orbit around each other. When two bodies move towards one another, if they travel slowly they will spiral inwards slowly until they collide or orbit each other indefinitely, and if they travel quickly they will fly along predictable parabolas or hyperbolas away from each other.</p>\n<p>When there are 3 bodies interacting with each other however, the situation becomes very chaotic. The paths that the 3 bodies take are highly complex and are unique, so will never repeat unlike the clear ellipses or parabolas when 2 bodies pass by each other. The slightest change (e.g. one of the bodies arrives one millisecond later) will drastically change the outcome. For example, rather than performing a series of rotations around each other before flying off, they could now all collide together.</p>\n<p>This is called the 3-body problem, and was the first discovered example of chaos in physics.</p>\n<h2>What is chaos theory?</h2>\n<p>Chaos theory is the branch of mathematics which focuses on finding underlying patterns and laws of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to their starting conditions, that had previously been thought of as completely random, in states of disorder and with irregularities.</p>\n<p>Chaos theory states that within the apparent randomness of chaotic complex systems, there are underlying patterns, interconnections, constant feedback loops, repetition, self-similarity, fractals, and self-organisation. These are the key principles of chaos theory.</p>\n<p>The chaotic systems, like the logistic map which we discussed earlier, are predictable for a while and then ‘appear’ to be random. The amount of time for which a chaotic system can be predicted depends on 3 factors: how much uncertainty can be tolerated; how accurately its current state can be measured; and a time scale which depends on the dynamics of the system (called the Lyapunov time).</p>\n<p>In chaotic systems, the prediction inaccuracy increases exponentially with time passed - for example, doubling the length of time passed in a forecast will result in an uncertainty which is more than squared. This means that an accurate prediction cannot be made for events too far in the future (after an interval of more than two or three times the Lyapunov time), which is when the system appears to become random.</p>\n<p>A commonly used definition, made by Robert L. Devaney, says that to be classified as chaotic, a dynamic system must have three properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It must be sensitive to initial conditions, which again relates back to the butterfly effect (a small change in one state of a system can result in large differences in a later state).</li>\n<li>It must be topologically transitive, which roughly means that neighbourhoods of points eventually get flung out to “big” sets so that they don’t necessarily stick together in one localised clump.</li>\n<li>It must have dense periodic orbits, which means that there must be attracting points in the system, which we have briefly talked about earlier.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For any interested, I highly recommend you go fuel your interest further online as I have only briefly covered the main aspects of chaos theory in this article. Thank you all for reading, I hope you enjoyed this article and can now tell people the difference between normal chaos and mathematical chaos.</p>\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Elwes, R 2011, 2012, How to solve the da vinci code and 34 other really interesting uses of mathematics, Quercus, London.</li>\n<li>Fractal Foundation (no date) What is chaos theory?.

No omission of the correct note or no inclusion of a wrong note will make a high scoring performance.</p>\n<p>Obviously in other musical contexts, a wrong note can be worked around. To quote Miles Davis: “When you hit a wrong note, it’s the next note that makes it good or bad”.</p>\n<p>However, in the context of 21st century piano competitions, to play a wrong note is to sin. It is the quickest way to notify the jurors that more time could have been spent working on the musical skeleton of the piece. Familiarising yourself with the pitches of the music is the highest priority before adding your own interpretational ideas to the piece.</p>\n<p>Obviously, fruity things happen on stage: perhaps you can feel a member of the jury really laying down judgement on you for your hair; maybe your mum is in the crowd somewhere; maybe you just don’t have a lot of experience. Whatever the reason, we can get nervous and make mistakes as a result. That’s just one of those things that happens. Even at the highest level, those performers are still human; depending on the musical context and degree of error, the mistake may go unnoticed. When you make a mistake in a performance setting: the best response is to ignore it and recover the piece.</p>\n<p>However, in a practice setting we should really be aiming for as perfect as possible. When you make a mistake during practice: the best response is to go back and correct it such that you minimise the chance of making the same mistake again. This also ensures that we learn the music as written - reducing our chance of producing errors on stage.</p>\n<p>Practice slowly and diligently. Our art form is a discipline, first and foremost. To quote a certain concert pianist when asked why he never played wrong notes, “I don’t practice them”. The need for self control cannot be understated here, so going slow and steady with a metronome is ideal. If you are recapitulating lines of music without any attention to exactly what you hear, that’s not really practising - that’s playing.</p>\n<p>Our goal when practising should be to play through something without making mistakes - this means we cannot approximate or guess anything: not the time, not the melody, not the fingering. Every detail should be deliberate and controlled.</p>\n<p>The amount of music you end up playing doesn’t matter. During practice, the only metric you should be counting is the number of mistakes you make. Graham Fitch emphasises the quality of practice being important: suggesting a routine of smaller, focussed practice sessions of 20-30 minutes each. The bottom line is if you cannot play a piece through slowly with no mistakes, you cannot assume that you can do so at tempo, whilst adding artistic flair and interpretation in a performance setting.</p>\n<h2>2 - Clarity as a Tool</h2>\n<p>Upon watching Bruce Liu’s final round performance, the first thing someone might notice is how blazingly fast Liu can play. It becomes really obvious that this guy goes at whatever speed he wants because of his technical capacity. While his competitors might be surviving through certain passages, Liu exercises his talent-founded prerogative to play them however he likes. It’s really easy to forget or outright dismiss other merits of Liu’s playing given his captivating dexterity.</p>\n<p>Complementing Liu’s demonic speed and fluidity is his crystalline clarity. We might talk about a melody being particularly embellished with cascading runs and exciting turns but Liu really does play the ornaments - there are no real embellishments. The “embellishments” are considered part of the melody.</p>\n<p>Clarity is the result of a strong technical foundation combined with true legato. Because of that, it allows us to communicate that we are technically fluent and mechanically able to express ourselves on our instrument - it gives your performance a virtuosic spice. More importantly, clarity helps communicate melodic ideas to our audience. Musical ideas may not form as a result of clarity, but they are often greatly aided by it; if the audience cannot clearly make out what we are playing, we cannot hope to communicate our musical ideas to them.</p>\n<p>Liu is clearly an incredibly talented individual and plays better than the majority of us could ever hope to play. In an interview for The Korea Times, Liu humbly stated that piano is just a “hobby” which he carries lots of passion for. However, is there anything that we could take away from his playing?</p>\n<p>We often are easily able to achieve the connection part of legato by allowing our notes to overlap each other. However, that makes our playing hazy and we lose clarity. One way to improve clarity from practice is to practise our melodies staccato. After a few times, we can gradually lengthen the duration of the notes we play until they are connected without overlapping. At this point we will have achieved true legato with perfect clarity.</p>\n<h2>3 - The Need for Musicality</h2>\n<p>Fans of Aimi Kobayashi may look back to her showing in 2015 and remember the agitation and fire she played with. A raw, emotionally turbulent player who dictated rubato, dynamics, and articulation to create a crude sensation.</p>\n<p>In contrast, the Aimi Kobayashi who came out last year was much more controlled and deliberate. She still encapsulates reverie and effect extremely well, but there’s a hint of refinement in it. The kind of control that you’d only expect from someone who could perceive time slower - that’s what she showed us last year.</p>\n<p>In her performance of the Concerto in E minor, op.11 in the final round, Kobayashi played at a much slower tempo than the accepted interpretation. She chose to throw away virtuosity in exchange for delicate, contoured playing. It’s at this slower tempo that Kobayashi shows off her ability to craft and shape melodic lines into something beyond the standard often displayed at the highest level. Kobayashi’s delicate touches dance effortlessly across the higher register and cascade melodiously downwards. Despite the slower tempo, it’s still very much Kobayashi: emotional playing directed meticulously by the individual fingers; she’s just being honest about her interpretation. It’s a brave thing to go against the grain in any context, but especially so in a well established piece at an international competition. From a competitive standpoint it falls short, Kobayashi misses out on opportunities to show off her technicality; from a musical standpoint her gambit paid dividends: although it’s not quite the technical spectacle of Bruce Liu, it’s utterly beautiful.</p>\n<p>Some identifying characteristics of Chopin’s work are the lyrical melodies which often sit upon a strong harmonic accompaniment which really carry his heightened level of emotional expression. Kobayashi takes this writing and invites herself to freely express herself musically across the piano.</p>\n<p>I think what we could all learn from her performance is how the temperament of your nature can affect your playing. Sometimes it may seem musically inappropriate, but there is a reward to allowing yourself to actually play more. Of course, it is also important to recognise when you are overplaying but that’s something that comes with time, as it did for Kobayashi.</p>\n<p>In practise we can work on our musicality by really playing to our ear’s decree. “Is what I’m playing really what I want it to sound like?” If we find ourselves struggling, we can turn to other sources for inspiration: “how does famous performer A play this part? How does famous performer B do it? Which do I prefer?”. Find out how your teacher might play that line. Questions like these can shape our interpretations immensely. Fuss over every detail to make sure your work is a true expression of self.</p>\n<h2>4 - Communication is Key</h2>\n<p>As Tiffany Poon noted in a 2020 interview with Bachtrack, classical music has a “disconnect between the audience and the music. The composers are dead and there just isn’t that human connection anymore.” She’s profoundly right.</p>\n<p>Hayato Sumino might not have made it into the final round, but he definitely reached a lot of people with his communicative instinct. His first round performance has so far garnered 2.8 million views, the most of any non final round performance.</p>\n<p>Listening to Sumino is really easy. He writes all his feelings and nuances down on a piece of paper for you to look at and read. Although Kobayashi is musically brilliant, it’s not quite as near to us as Sumino. And I feel like that’s exactly what makes him so great; Sumino has this ability to speak to us through his playing: every little articulation carries that spark of life which, in turn, gives his performances a refreshing vitality.</p>\n<p>Sometimes we have a specific narrative to convey if we are playing program music. Of course, in this scenario our job, as the musicians, is to pass on the extramusical meaning to our audience.</p>\n<p>Sometimes we are lucky enough to have a creative motive accessible to us; in this case it might be worth trying to come up with your own related narrative to communicate back to the audience.</p>\n<p>If we are very unfortunate, we might not have the background or creative motive behind a piece accessible to us either. In such cases, a safe but liberating approach is to extrapolate whatever emotions naturally come to you from the music.</p>\n<p>I think for a lot of us musicians, we don’t really struggle with conveying any given emotion on command. It’s just the ambiguity of what we are meant to do given source material which has gone through potentially hundreds of years. My interpretation cannot bring Schubert’s very will and message back.</p>\n<p>A first step towards improving your communication on your instrument is to define exactly what emotion you, the performer, are trying to convey - not the emotion that the composer wanted to convey, and certainly not whatever emotion the audience will extrapolate from you. We want to keep the creative vision in our mind transparent, not sentimentally self-indulgent, and most importantly - it should largely come from us.</p>\n<p>Once we have defined our creative vision, we should then be able to use our sonar palette to shape our interpretation into a refined product. As clichéd as it sounds, there isn’t really an incorrect answer here - but it has to be with the goal of communicating. “Does that tenuto actually help us convey an emotion or does it feel good to play?” The clearer your creative vision is, the easier this part should be.</p>\n<p>It’s important to understand that your interpretation can change.Allow yourself to change bits of it - allow your musicality to guide your creative choices, including how you choose to communicate a piece.</p>\n<h2>Closing Comments</h2>\n<p>As Adam Neely famously thrice said, \"repetition legitimises\". With that in spirit let's quickly recap the 4 main points:\r\nBefore refining an interpretation, practise slowly and make sure you are playing the correct notes\r\nImprove your clarity by practising the quality of legato\r\nDeeply consider your interpretation of the music, and let your musicality guide it\r\nDon't forget to make sure you do a good job of communicating your interpretation\r\nThe International Chopin Piano Competition is one of the world's most prestigious piano competitions, which are becoming increasingly competitive each year.

Apollo 11 had just launched from Earth, and was carrying on board the first people to ever land on the Moon. It was a pivotal point for mankind, and marked as one of the greatest achievements of space travel, paving the way for many more accomplishments. Over 50 years later, we stand once more, on a pivotal point like no other. We are on the cusp of being able to colonise Mars, discover the secrets of new galaxies, and commercialise space travel for all. Let’s have a look at some of the ground-breaking ideas that will help us make these dreams reality.</p>\n<p>Firstly, let’s look at rockets. We currently use chemical thrusters to reach space, combusting liquid oxygen with liquid hydrogen. Although it gets the job done, it is extremely inefficient, as most of the weight of the rocket consists of fuel, and only 5% [1] of it is the payload- the object we want to actually send to space.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the future of rockets looks very bright, with lots of alternative fuel sources currently being proposed and researched into. As of now, the most successful projects are ones which use ion fuelled engines, better known as electric system engines, as they only use electricity to propel ions. Rather than lighting up liquid fuel to accelerate, ion fuelled engines spew ions at much faster velocities, and are significantly more efficient and longer lasting than chemical engines. The best chemical rockets have a fuel efficiency of around 35%, whereas ion rockets have an efficiency of 80-90%. [2]</p>\n<p>In an ion thruster, an inert gas (usually xenon) is bombarded by high-speed electrons inside a discharge chamber. These high-speed electrons collide with and strip away the electrons from the xenon atoms, creating more free electrons as well as ionising xenon atoms into positively charged xenon ions (this is called an ionising event). This soup of positively charged xenon ions and negatively charged electrons is now in a state called plasma. Although this plasma has both positive ions and negative electrons, overall, the charge is neutral. This is known as quasi-neutral plasma. Electromagnetic fields and a high voltage are used to speed up and push out the ions from the discharge chamber and out of the thrusters at very high velocities, accelerating the spacecraft. Once out of the thrusters, an electron beam shoots out electrons in order to neutralise the xenon ions, so they don’t strip electrons from the spacecraft itself. The electromagnetic fields keep the extra electrons within the discharge chamber, increasing the ionising events, making it more efficient. They also minimise the electrons hitting the walls of the chamber in order to increase the engine’s durability. This whole system is powered by solar panels, so no battery or power system is needed, minimising the total weight of the spacecraft.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 460px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/ff6721d836f9474348a689c02f1a91df/e41a8/ionthruster1.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 69.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAOABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQFA//EABYBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMBAv/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAABtTqeFwgOjn//xAAaEAACAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgEDERMU/9oACAEBAAEFAmfFa+T1OYcVyKUk/8QAGhEAAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAxIxUf/aAAgBAwEBPwGSk9GFnT//xAAZEQACAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMSQVH/2gAIAQIBAT8BTWl4+H//xAAaEAADAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREQITEy/9oACAEBAAY/ArGWJnFizZ4R/8QAGxABAAIDAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARITFRcYH/2gAIAQEAAT8hyyVsQOTiJ5HenL2IJBy3qH3R9Z//2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEGsP/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAR/9oACAEDAQE/EEDeTD//xAAZEQACAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREx4fD/2gAIAQIBAT8QUpIu+n//xAAeEAEAAgIBBQAAAAAAAAAAAAABABFBYSExcYGR0f/aAAgBAQABPxAG6xVJAEUtITtHxWL/AGXjRwNT1BoQWXLTNHyiX//Z'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Ion thruster\"\n        title=\"Ion thruster\"\n        src=\"/static/ff6721d836f9474348a689c02f1a91df/e41a8/ionthruster1.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ff6721d836f9474348a689c02f1a91df/e07e9/ionthruster1.jpg 200w,\n/static/ff6721d836f9474348a689c02f1a91df/066f9/ionthruster1.jpg 400w,\n/static/ff6721d836f9474348a689c02f1a91df/e41a8/ionthruster1.jpg 460w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Although these ion thrusters don’t produce as much thrust as chemical rockets, and can’t yet be used to escape Earth’s gravity well, they can last for months at full throttle (until they run out of fuel). This makes them extremely efficient in space, where there’s no gravity or air resistance, and slowly accelerating a spacecraft for weeks adds up the velocity, allowing it to travel at incredibly high velocities after just a couple of weeks of constant acceleration. A chemical rocket has a maximum velocity of around 40,000 mph. On the other hand, ion engines reach a velocity of 100,000mph, and NASA is researching and developing an ion engine which can theoretically reach up to 500,000mph. [3] Ion engines are already used in many satellites in order to keep them in orbit, and were used to propel NASA’s Dawn spacecraft (launched in 2007) deep into our solar system. Dawn was the first spacecraft to orbit two objects in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter: The protoplanets Vesta and Ceres.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 546px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/bedc1720c0148c347c78d748ef2dde04/f066e/spacestation.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 55.99999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Spacecraft\"\n        title=\"Spacecraft\"\n        src=\"/static/bedc1720c0148c347c78d748ef2dde04/f066e/spacestation.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/bedc1720c0148c347c78d748ef2dde04/e07e9/spacestation.jpg 200w,\n/static/bedc1720c0148c347c78d748ef2dde04/066f9/spacestation.jpg 400w,\n/static/bedc1720c0148c347c78d748ef2dde04/f066e/spacestation.jpg 546w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>To summarise, chemical engines are used up very quickly. The Falcon Heavy is about 550 metric tonnes, and 400 metric tonnes of it is fuel. This fuel is entirely consumed in 9.5 minutes [1], at which point the payload is in space. Whilst chemical rockets are still the easiest way to send objects into space, a typical mission to Mars will take about 9 months, because the spacecraft cannot afford to use any more fuel to accelerate in space, and will simply cruise its way to Mars. However, spacecraft utilising both chemical rockets to enter space, and ion engines to gain additional velocity in space, can reach Mars in just over a month, cutting travel times by nearly 90%. Ion engines hold lots of potential, and NASA are in the final stages of testing and improving their endurance and reliability, so we can use them on manned spacecraft.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 485px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/c9f9d769e30ba73b25b237f445730798/44c61/Falcon.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 48.50000000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Falcon\"\n        title=\"Falcon\"\n        src=\"/static/c9f9d769e30ba73b25b237f445730798/44c61/Falcon.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/c9f9d769e30ba73b25b237f445730798/772e8/Falcon.png 200w,\n/static/c9f9d769e30ba73b25b237f445730798/e17e5/Falcon.png 400w,\n/static/c9f9d769e30ba73b25b237f445730798/44c61/Falcon.png 485w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>We already know that even though chemical rockets are our only way of going to space, they are very expensive and relatively inefficient. Luckily for us, there could be another way to go to space: Skyhooks.\r\nSkyhooks are a simple and extremely effective method of sending objects into space. Currently, a rocket has to travel about 400km to deliver a payload into low orbit, such as the ISS. This takes a considerable amount of fuel and money, even more so if you are trying to fly to another planet. A skyhook could make it so you only have to fly 20% of the distance, and the skyhook would throw you into space.</p>\n<p>But what actually is a skyhook? Put simply, a skyhook is a giant spinning tether, with a counterweight on it. This superstructure would have two ends, the lowest about 80km above earth’s surface, and the highest about 1000km above earth. The craft would dock to its tether at the lowest point, and gain angular momentum as the skyhook rotated, as well as orbiting earth. Once the tether has reached its highest point, the craft would be released and propelled into space, carrying extra velocity from the skyhook. This not only reduces the fuel needed to send satellites and such into space, but also allows us to travel quicker and further, as almost all fuel is used to get out of Earth’s gravity well.  If we can use this alternative, we can conserve our fuel and use it to travel in space itself faster. We can even build skyhooks to orbit the Moon, or even Mars, using one of its Moons as a counterweight, and making a much larger skyhook to catapult us to the far depths of our solar system, at a much more affordable price and shorter time frame.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 546px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/0147c6434183c390ef04fc3f3d326d81/76aed/Skyhook.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 53%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Sky hook\"\n        title=\"Sky hook\"\n        src=\"/static/0147c6434183c390ef04fc3f3d326d81/76aed/Skyhook.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/0147c6434183c390ef04fc3f3d326d81/772e8/Skyhook.png 200w,\n/static/0147c6434183c390ef04fc3f3d326d81/e17e5/Skyhook.png 400w,\n/static/0147c6434183c390ef04fc3f3d326d81/76aed/Skyhook.png 546w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Despite this seemingly archaic idea to catapult things into space, the science behind the skyhook is sound, and it is even possible to create it with our current technology! There are many materials that are contenders to be used in the making of the tether, with a material called Zylon [4] in the lead. Zylon is extremely heat-resistant, a crucial feature as the bottom of the space tether is still in the Earth’s atmosphere, and will experience some air resistance and a lot of friction. Fortunately, at 80km above the Earth’s surface, the atmosphere is very thin and air resistance is bearable for the superstructure. Zylon is also over one and half times stronger than Kevlar, and barely changes length when put under intense tensions. All very useful properties to face space debris and endurance testing. Using the law of conservation of momentum, every time a skyhook sends a spacecraft into space, in order for the spacecraft to move faster, the superstructure will impart some of its own momentum on the spacecraft, slowing its own momentum. If this continues to happen, the skyhook will stop rotating and may even fall out of the sky and crash down to earth. This is why there will be small boosters (similar to the ones currently on satellites) to replenish the skyhook's momentum. Another way we can keep the skyhooks in the air is by doing the reverse of what we already do, as this would give energy to the skyhook, essentially replenishing its angular momentum. This would occur by “catching” high speed spacecraft in high orbit as they come back to Earth, slowing them down, and releasing them in low orbit. If done right, this can make skyhooks entirely self-sustaining, meaning they become more cost-effective the more we use them.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 612px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/436bb4c440479b3c00bf86846de6addf/8c76f/Planets.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 53%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Planets\"\n        title=\"Planets\"\n        src=\"/static/436bb4c440479b3c00bf86846de6addf/8c76f/Planets.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/436bb4c440479b3c00bf86846de6addf/772e8/Planets.png 200w,\n/static/436bb4c440479b3c00bf86846de6addf/e17e5/Planets.png 400w,\n/static/436bb4c440479b3c00bf86846de6addf/8c76f/Planets.png 612w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 413px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/0509911d76025f277ba8efe76080c093/6c1e7/Hubble.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 72.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Hubble\"\n        title=\"Hubble\"\n        src=\"/static/0509911d76025f277ba8efe76080c093/6c1e7/Hubble.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/0509911d76025f277ba8efe76080c093/772e8/Hubble.png 200w,\n/static/0509911d76025f277ba8efe76080c093/e17e5/Hubble.png 400w,\n/static/0509911d76025f277ba8efe76080c093/6c1e7/Hubble.png 413w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 413px) 100vw, 413px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Since skyhooks can reduce the flight distance by about 80%, rockets can also be around 80% [5] smaller and considerably cheaper, although they will be remodelled so they can fly to and get caught by skyhooks. With the addition of skyhooks on other celestial bodies too, skyhooks could make future space travel cheaper and even commercialised, with planets such as Mars only one skyhook away. Skyhooks on a much smaller scale have already been tested and put into space, with great success, so it's only a matter of time before space agencies invest in creating these superstructures. With a bit of luck, and a lot of hard work, we may see the commercialisation of space travel happen very soon.</p>\n<p>So far, we’ve seen technology that can be implemented within this century, with the concepts being very realistic. What about something more… theoretical?</p>\n<p>Introducing wormholes.</p>\n<p>Wormholes are a special phenomenon, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, could exist. They are essentially doorways to a different part of the universe, whether that be a few metres apart, or billions of light years away. Using Einstein’s theory of general relativity [6], we can see that the mathematics checks out, and that they can indeed exist. But just because something can exist in theory, it doesn’t mean it necessarily does exist in reality, and we have not (yet) found any naturally existing wormholes. But first, some explanation and context of what wormholes and general relativity are.</p>\n<p>The theory of general relativity, simply put, is a way of describing how gravity works, and is our best description of it till this day. One key concept is how the very fabric of space-time works. Imagine if space-time is a trampoline. On its own, its flat, and there is no curvature. If I put a kettlebell on it, it will bend, and depending on the weight and shape of the kettlebell, it will curve differently. This is exactly how space-time works; objects such as stars and planets have a volume and gravity, and this gravity curves space-time. We already know that blackholes exist, and that they have such a strong gravity, warping space-time to the point where even light, the fastest thing in the universe, cannot escape its grasp.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 315px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/bdc3bb851186e65fe79166dd95aab874/a6688/Generalrelativity.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 132.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"General relativity\"\n        title=\"General relativity\"\n        src=\"/static/bdc3bb851186e65fe79166dd95aab874/a6688/Generalrelativity.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/bdc3bb851186e65fe79166dd95aab874/e07e9/Generalrelativity.jpg 200w,\n/static/bdc3bb851186e65fe79166dd95aab874/a6688/Generalrelativity.jpg 315w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>But what if we took the trampoline and curved it so much that two opposite ends meet, and then we punch a hole through that? This is what wormholes do. They warp space-time so much that the space-time between two far apart places creases in on itself, and upon creating a hole through this crease, you have essentially closed the distance to virtually nothing. Another way of visualising this is if you think of the universe in 2D, as a big flat sheet. If this sheet is bent in just the right way, a wormhole can be created through the sheet. This method is technically faster than the speed of light itself, as you have taken a much shorter route.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 540px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/c834caf33203fadfa870e64df9de16ae/09d21/Wormhole.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Wormhole\"\n        title=\"Wormhole\"\n        src=\"/static/c834caf33203fadfa870e64df9de16ae/09d21/Wormhole.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/c834caf33203fadfa870e64df9de16ae/e07e9/Wormhole.jpg 200w,\n/static/c834caf33203fadfa870e64df9de16ae/066f9/Wormhole.jpg 400w,\n/static/c834caf33203fadfa870e64df9de16ae/09d21/Wormhole.jpg 540w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>As you can see, even though the maths behind wormholes checks out, in reality it does sound like science fiction. But what if instead of looking for wormholes, we try something crazier. We could try to make them ourselves.</p>\n<p>In order to create a traversable wormhole (a wormhole we can freely travel through back and forth), we need three main criteria. Firstly, we need them to connect two distant places, such as Earth and Saturn. Secondly, they should have an entry and exist, without any event horizons, like blackholes, as that would make travel impossible. Lastly, they need to be big enough so that humans can travel through them without the G-forces killing us. The hardest part will be to keep our wormholes open. No matter how big our wormholes may be, the gravitational forces acting on the wormhole will be so strong that it will always be forced closed, unless we have some material that is strong enough to go against gravity to keep it open. This material has to have unique properties; the properties of exotic matter. Exotic matter is nothing like any matter we have seen previously, or even antimatter, which consists of the antiparticles of the particles of mass. Exotic matter has negative mass, meaning it will be able to repel any matter, and essentially repel against gravity itself. Surprisingly, this doesn’t introduce any violation of the laws of conservation and energy, and are still mathematically consistent. This would be able to hold up our wormhole, and make not only space travel, but any sort of travel at all, reach new and unprecedented heights. There are even some exotic atoms and exotic hadrons, as well as other elements which may possess the properties of exotic matter. [7] However, some scientists believe that if you can travel faster than the speed of light, that means time travel should be possible, and this would break our fundamental laws of physics. For this reason, many believe that not wormholes cannot be found or created.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 519px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/af56a485c1e62171b683edc88b7a345e/eac85/Conservation.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 50.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Conservation\"\n        title=\"Conservation\"\n        src=\"/static/af56a485c1e62171b683edc88b7a345e/eac85/Conservation.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/af56a485c1e62171b683edc88b7a345e/e07e9/Conservation.jpg 200w,\n/static/af56a485c1e62171b683edc88b7a345e/066f9/Conservation.jpg 400w,\n/static/af56a485c1e62171b683edc88b7a345e/eac85/Conservation.jpg 519w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>For now, wormholes exist only on paper, and in our dreams.

Perhaps ion engines will make travelling to Mars as easy as catching a train, or skyhooks will let us travel to the Kuiper belt, where we can mine alluring new minerals, and even find exotic matter needed to open wormholes.

The rapid pace at which technology is evolving is bringing forth the possibility of daily space travel, which earlier seemed to be a distant fantasy. This rate of development, with the aid of continuous innovation from private firms within the industry, raises the question of how long will we have to wait before star systems become within our grasp?</p>\n<p>The viability of eventually traversing exoplanets, planets outside our solar system, relies on two main factors – our ability to detect them and proficiency in discovering the climate on these planets to test for their habitability. The second of these factors is made much easier once the first is tackled.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to detect an exoplanet would just be to observe it. However, this is much more difficult than it first seems since we are able to perceive objects due to light reflecting off them. In the case of exoplanets, regardless of whether an atmosphere is present that reflects an abundance of light, the light that is reflected by the exoplanet will be overwhelmed by the light being emitted by the host star. It is analogous to holding a candle in front of stadium lights; although the flame is there, you cannot see it as it is inundated by the luminosity of the floodlights. As a result, we must explore three other methods for detecting and classifying exoplanets: Radial velocity, transits, and gravitational microlensing.</p>\n<p>The radial velocity method is one of the simplest and relies on the interaction of gravitational fields, irrespective of the masses present. You may recall that every object with a mass is accompanied with a gravitational field and the heavier the object, the stronger the gravitational field. Therefore, a planet also has a gravitational effect on its star despite being a miniscule one. This causes a wobbling of the star and can in turn be used to detect exoplanets. Due to this wobble being more pronounced the closer a planet is and the larger the mass of the planet.</p>\n<p>This method is most easily used on millisecond pulsars which are a special type of star formed from the remnants of a supernova and very dense and very radioactive so even if there are planets here, they are never going to be habitable. What is special about millisecond pulsars is that they release exact periodic pulses of radio waves which can be measured from Earth and plotted against time. If there exists a planet in orbit around a millisecond pulsar then it causes the pulses, every so often, to be offbeat.</p>\n<p>This ‘offbeat’ pulse is regularly repeated thus giving astronomers the value of the period of the orbit the planet has around the pulsar. Using this and formula 1, you can calculate the radius of the orbit of the planet.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto;

most notably, it must be done on millisecond pulsars otherwise the observation time of the pulses will need to be over years rather than days or weeks. Secondly, if we are trying to find habitable planets then this is completely the wrong place to look as no life would survive under the harsh radioactive conditions. Thirdly, even if a planet is very close in, it produces a very small wobble so any planet further out, maybe in the goldilocks zone (a region of orbit around a star where it is possible for liquid water to exist), will not be detectable with this method as the wobble just would not be distinguishable. Fourthly, the planets found using this method are almost always hot Jupiters as they are both close in and are ‘massive’. A hot Jupiter is a Jupiter-sized planet, which could be rocky or gaseous that is very close to its host star hence it is hot. Finally, using this method we have no way to prove that what we are measuring the effects of is a planet or if it is a dwarf star in a binary system with the pulsar. To prove that it is in fact a planet we need to know both its mass and density, we have mass but to find density we must use the next method, transit.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 386px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/2b1118e175ffc0d75cab13b1c81a8806/7bc0b/Formula4.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 49%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Formula 4\"\n        title=\"Formula 4\"\n        src=\"/static/2b1118e175ffc0d75cab13b1c81a8806/7bc0b/Formula4.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/2b1118e175ffc0d75cab13b1c81a8806/772e8/Formula4.png 200w,\n/static/2b1118e175ffc0d75cab13b1c81a8806/7bc0b/Formula4.png 386w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Transits are events that happen when an exoplanet passes in front of its host star relative to us.

For every transit there exists a secondary transit, which happens when the planet is behind the star and a secondary dip in brightness is observed. This is due to the fact that a planet is reflective so at every point except when the planet is behind the star it is also contributing very slightly to the light that reaches us. A graph of flux (a measure of brightness) against time is shown below:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 670px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/0cb27d98af1c315129c9074583bcacd1/d67fd/Secondarytransit.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 59.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Secondary transit\"\n        title=\"Secondary transit\"\n        src=\"/static/0cb27d98af1c315129c9074583bcacd1/d67fd/Secondarytransit.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/0cb27d98af1c315129c9074583bcacd1/772e8/Secondarytransit.png 200w,\n/static/0cb27d98af1c315129c9074583bcacd1/e17e5/Secondarytransit.png 400w,\n/static/0cb27d98af1c315129c9074583bcacd1/d67fd/Secondarytransit.png 670w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Secondary transits are very difficult to do as the change in brightness is miniscule and indistinguishable from atmospheric disturbance in telescopes on Earth. Which is why space telescopes such as Hubble and Spitzer are used, recently the James Webb was also added to the fleet.</p>\n<p>By subtracting a spectrum taken during the secondary transit from one taken just out of the secondary transit, the spectrum of the day side of the planet can be obtained and thus planets like J1719-1438 can be discovered. This planet also dubbed as the ‘diamond planet’ has around the mass of Jupiter but has the size of a core of a dwarf star, this extreme density causes massive pressures on the mostly carbon surface turning it into diamonds. Even though many planets have been discovered by Kepler, Spritzer, Hubble and many more using this method, they all have one flaw that is shared with the planets discovered using radial velocity measurements; almost all of them are hot Jupiters and if not then they are just extremely hot rocky planets. To help solve this and allow us to ‘see’ more Earth-like planets, we need to employ the phenomenon of gravitational microlensing.</p>\n<p>Gravity, although the weakest of the four fundamental forces, can bend light by bending the fabric of space-time. In this way, when we look at a very distant object such as the bulge at the centre of our galaxy, and a massive object comes in between (for the sake of this explanation let’s say it comes directly halfway in between) our line of sight, it distorts the image we perceive. This very effect is called gravitational microlensing and has been demonstrated in the example below.</p>\n<p>Diagram 1 shows a singular ray of light from the focus (the bulge at the centre of the galaxy) as it is bent around the lens star leading to an increase in brightness of the image.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 498px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/7364a1a7b90354f79f85f4897417fe41/79e1b/Diagram1.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 73.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Diagram 1\"\n        title=\"Diagram 1\"\n        src=\"/static/7364a1a7b90354f79f85f4897417fe41/79e1b/Diagram1.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/7364a1a7b90354f79f85f4897417fe41/772e8/Diagram1.png 200w,\n/static/7364a1a7b90354f79f85f4897417fe41/e17e5/Diagram1.png 400w,\n/static/7364a1a7b90354f79f85f4897417fe41/79e1b/Diagram1.png 498w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>If we instead look at every ray rather than singular ones, we see something like image 1:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 489px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/60320e94004759a6777c0fe59a973f19/03e1f/Image1.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 67.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Image 1\"\n        title=\"Image 1\"\n        src=\"/static/60320e94004759a6777c0fe59a973f19/03e1f/Image1.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/60320e94004759a6777c0fe59a973f19/772e8/Image1.png 200w,\n/static/60320e94004759a6777c0fe59a973f19/e17e5/Image1.png 400w,\n/static/60320e94004759a6777c0fe59a973f19/03e1f/Image1.png 489w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Since we know what the focus image behind the lens looks like ‘normally’, we are able to reverse engineer a lens shape to fit the scenario. The lens is what we are interested in as there are distinct patterns that emerge if the lens is just a lone star versus if it has a planet in its orbit. This is a very powerful, although rare, tool because we now have a way to detect the previously elusive ‘non-Hot Jupiters’ also known as Super-Earths or Mini-Neptunes which lie further out from the star. What seems to be microlensing’s Achilles heel is the fact that it is a very rare event so while it may be our ace method, it is unreliable.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, I think the idea of human beings leaving our solar system is currently absurd and will be for many hundreds of years mostly because, evident to this article, we wouldn’t know where to go. There are many theoretical models for space travel but all of them focus on the journey rather than the end point, if we cannot find perfectly habitable planets close to us then I think it is a waste of resources to experiment ways to get there. It is much more prudent for Mars and Venus to be our top priority. On the other hand, we as a species are very adept at accelerating scientific progress at the cost of our planet, so who is to say we won’t breakthrough again to find Earth 2.0.</p>\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>All graphs and equations come from the exoplanets course; <a href=\"https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:ANUx+ANU-ASTRO2x+2T2020/home\">Course | Astrophysics: Exploring Exoplanets | edX</a></li>\n<li>Diagram 1; <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/gravitational-microlensing\">gravitational microlensing | astronomy | Britannica</a></li>\n<li>Image 1; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_microlensing#/media/File:A_Horseshoe_Einstein_Ring_from_Hubble.JPG\">A Horseshoe Einstein Ring from Hubble - Gravitational microlensing - Wikipedia</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"type":"Article","first_name":null,"surname":null,"school":null,"pronouns":null,"role":null,"slug":"/articles/aa9f7f12-99a4-4cd4-97fa-2edf1fc1f2d3","profile_picture":null,"title":"Future of humanity","subject":"9C2111","userID":"454e60d1-f934-489d-9abc-ca906a054caf","articleID":"aa9f7f12-99a4-4cd4-97fa-2edf1fc1f2d3","preview_image":"SpaceConoly.jpg","video_url":null,"issue":1}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/profiles/21bf8680-1107-4bc6-b4d3-19534e357aed"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
