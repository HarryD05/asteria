Probing further into the last two, 3D techniques were often used to simulate a large movement or environment, e.g. the wildebeest stampede scene in The Lion King, whilst the entire Tarzan jungle was created in 3D with a hand drawn Tarzan swinging through. The pioneering computer animation software they used at the time for this effect was Deep Canvas.</p>\n</div>\n<p>In fact, the Oscar-nominated Apple TV film “Wolf-walkers” (2020) used 3D models and VR to create a CGI forest much like Tarzan. However, the animators took this one step further and recreated each scene by hand, using graphite on thousands of sheets of paper - to mimic art from the 1600s. Ultimately, 2.5D serves as an in-between medium to make use of the best of both worlds. “The idea was that it would not feel too clinical, too clean, too artificial,” says Eimhin McNamara, an animator at Cartoon Saloon - which produced Wolf-walkers. He also shares that “it helps you feel like you're actually in the head of the character.” To help with the time-consuming process, they played with the frame rate - dropping it down from 24 fps (frames-per-second) to 12 fps, meaning they drew 12 images for every second. Still a very painstaking task if you ask me!</p>\n<div class=\"image-card-right\">\n    <p>Talking more about the video games side of things, pseudo 3D games first came about in arcades in the mid-1970s. ‘Interceptor’, a combat flight simulator game by Taito, was supposedly the first arcade game to make use of 2.5D with its “eight-way directional movement, shooting down enemy planes, and depth perception by size-changing enemy planes.” Moving further in time, we find more titles such as Donkey Kong Country, which features 3D characters and backgrounds, but with restricted 2D plane movement - ending up as a 2.5D game.</p>\n    <div class=\"image\"><div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 509px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/a4430a7c8ea06dca6ea66a97ffb2d423/05852/Interceptor.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 87.99999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Interceptor\" title=\"Interceptor\" src=\"/static/a4430a7c8ea06dca6ea66a97ffb2d423/05852/Interceptor.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/a4430a7c8ea06dca6ea66a97ffb2d423/e07e9/Interceptor.jpg 200w,\n/static/a4430a7c8ea06dca6ea66a97ffb2d423/066f9/Interceptor.jpg 400w,\n/static/a4430a7c8ea06dca6ea66a97ffb2d423/05852/Interceptor.jpg 509w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"image-card-left\">\n    <div class=\"image\"><div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 201px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/b4e1470d96aac53ba45d919961f025d0/e0b5a/Donkeykong.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 114.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Donkey kong\" title=\"Donkey kong\" src=\"/static/b4e1470d96aac53ba45d919961f025d0/e0b5a/Donkeykong.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/b4e1470d96aac53ba45d919961f025d0/e07e9/Donkeykong.jpg 200w,\n/static/b4e1470d96aac53ba45d919961f025d0/e0b5a/Donkeykong.jpg 201w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 201px) 100vw, 201px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div></div>\n    <p>There is however, a key difference between 2.5D used in games and in films. In video games, this technique is used more often by playing with perspectives. An isometric view, such as the one depicted on the left, gives the illusion of 2D characters being shown as 3D. Nevertheless, like Donkey Kong Country, the side-scrolling 2D plane movement makes games like these in 2.5D perspective. The reason for using this technique was initially to do with limitations of the hardware systems - e.g. generating full 3D games required a lot more power than a NES could provide at the time. Nowadays, much like with films, it’s a choice made for the realism and in-depth, immersive feel you get from a 3D-style.</p>\n</div>\n<p>In conclusion, 2.5D is a relatively generic term that describes a combination of animation styles used in making films and video games or an illusion of 2D and 3D. In fact, most of the entertainment that you usually consume is in fact in 2.5D - you just didn’t know it! Keep an eye out for it next time you watch a Netflix movie thinking it’s entirely either 2D or 3D, looks can be deceiving…</p>\n<div id=\"bibliography\">\r\n<h2>Bibliography:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.insider.com/how-wolfwalkers-used-3d-tech-to-transform-25d-animation-2021-2#:~:text=But%20many%20films%20actually%20fall,a%20unique%20hand%2Ddrawn%20style.\">https://www.insider.com/how-wolfwalkers-used-3d-tech-to-transform-25d-animation-2021-2#:~:text=But%20many%20films%20actually%20fall,a%20unique%20hand%2Ddrawn%20style.</a></li></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mangaplanet.com/what-is-25d/\">https://mangaplanet.com/what-is-25d/</a></li></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bullfrag.com/what-are-2-5d-games-and-how-do-they-work/\">https://www.bullfrag.com/what-are-2-5d-games-and-how-do-they-work/</a></li></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-2-5d-games-2d-3d/\">https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-2-5d-games-2d-3d/</a></li></li>\n</ul>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"type":"Article","first_name":null,"surname":null,"school":null,"pronouns":null,"role":null,"slug":"/articles/1","profile_picture":null,"title":"Ever heard of 2.5D?","composer":null,"subject":"376B70","userID":null,"articleID":"1","userIDs":["x"],"preview_image":"netflix.jpg","issue":1}},{"html":"<p>In this article, we will be discussing the fundamentals of electrical signalling in the body. Electricity is required for the nervous system to send signals throughout the body and to the brain, making it possible for us to move, think and feel. This is only possible through our nervous systems and the use of neurons and action potentials.</p>\n<p>In the early nineteenth century, the nature of electricity remained vague to scientists. The history of bioelectricity began in 18th century Bologna, Italy when scientist Luigi Galvani was dissecting a frog [1]. As his assistant touched a nerve in the frog's leg with a metal scalpel, he noticed that it picked up static charge causing the frog's leg to move. Later another scientist called Alessandro Volta repeated Galvani’s experiments [2], but doubted the existence of an electric fluid intrinsic to animals. Further research led to him developing the first battery, proving that electricity could be generated outside of a living creature. Today, galvanism is known as the electrical phenomena in living beings.</p>\n<p>Firstly, in order to understand the basics we have to be aware of what a neuron is. A typical neuron contains a cell body and some which houses the cell’s nucleus and a variety of cellular machinery. It also consists of axons and dendrites extending out as well as an outer layer which is composed of a bilayer of lipid molecules that partition the inside of a cell from the outside. This is known as the cell membrane.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with the resting potential. When a cell is at rest, it is not electrically neutral. A small voltage is measured known as the membrane potential, which calculates to around 70 millivolts. The membrane potential of a neuron that is specifically “at rest” means that it is not sending or receiving signals. Another term we should be familiar with is the membrane potential. This is a general term that describes the voltage across the membrane. At any point in time, the membrane potential of a neuron can vary widely for example from -90mv to +60mv.</p>\n<h2>Equilibrium potentials</h2>\n<p>Now that we have visited resting and membrane potentials we shall introduce equilibrium potentials. The equilibrium potential is the electrical potential difference across the cell membrane that exactly balances the concentration gradient for an ion.\r\nConsider the case for a single ion. Movement of charged ions through a semipermeable membrane is governed by two forces: the concentration gradient (a difference in concentration) and the electrostatic gradient (an electrical potential difference). As ions move, the concentration gradient that drives movement decreases while the electrostatic gradient that opposes movement increases. This means that an equilibrium will always be reached where the concentration gradient is exactly equal and opposite to the electrostatic gradient. At this point, the electrostatic gradient is known as the equilibrium potential.</p>\n<div class=\"image-card-left\">\n    <div class=\"image\"><div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 337px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/08dafaedd7728a9b2823f099da2933fe/f6b51/equilibrium.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 110.99999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Equilibrium potential\" title=\"Equilibrium potential\" src=\"/static/08dafaedd7728a9b2823f099da2933fe/f6b51/equilibrium.png\" srcset=\"/static/08dafaedd7728a9b2823f099da2933fe/772e8/equilibrium.png 200w,\n/static/08dafaedd7728a9b2823f099da2933fe/f6b51/equilibrium.png 337w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div></div>\n    <em>This figure shows the movements of potassium ions across a cellular membrane- potassium ions leave the cell according to its concentration gradient, however this is accompanied by the movement of potassium ions into the cell as they are attracted towards the increasingly negative intracellular environment [3].</em>\n</div>\n<p>Several factors influence this equilibrium potential: the concentration of ions on both sides of the membrane (concentration gradient), temperature (increases the effect of the concentration gradient), and the charge of ions (increases the effect of voltage).  To maintain stable concentrations of both sodium and potassium, a sodium potassium pump is essential to maintain high intracellular potassium and high extracellular sodium. This pump actively transports potassium and sodium against their concentration gradients; this allows the concentration gradient that these ions travel down to be maintained and therefore, for the resting membrane potential to be maintained. You may have heard of the sodium potassium pump from your studies in Biology at GCSE and A Level, an example of active transport.</p>\n<h2>The Action Potential</h2>\n<p>Now that we have visited equilibrium potentials, it is time to consider action potentials. Action potentials occur when a neuron sends information down an axon away from the cell body. Neuroscientists use words such as spikes or impulses for the action potential as it is known as an explosion of electrical activity that is created by a depolarising current.</p>\n<p>Embedded in the membranes, channels change in response to their local environment, opening and closing at any given moment depending on their local membrane potential. Complex molecular machines are made from proteins. As voltage changes, the conformation of the protein shifts either opening and closing the pore of the channel, hence they are known as voltage-gated.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/cd86222f76e84c8d0627f0b07260cd5e/bb2fd/Actionpotential1.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 71.50000000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Action potential stages\"\n        title=\"Action potential stages\"\n        src=\"/static/cd86222f76e84c8d0627f0b07260cd5e/5a190/Actionpotential1.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/cd86222f76e84c8d0627f0b07260cd5e/772e8/Actionpotential1.png 200w,\n/static/cd86222f76e84c8d0627f0b07260cd5e/e17e5/Actionpotential1.png 400w,\n/static/cd86222f76e84c8d0627f0b07260cd5e/5a190/Actionpotential1.png 800w,\n/static/cd86222f76e84c8d0627f0b07260cd5e/bb2fd/Actionpotential1.png 1058w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<div class=\"centre\"><em>This figure [4] shows the stages of the action potential, explained below. Graph of membrane potential (mv) against time (ms)</em></div>\n<p>The action potential can be broken down into a few stages. The first stage begins with the activation of the action potential, during which a few Na+ channels open causing depolarisation to reach threshold potential (the potential when the inward Na+ current balances the outward K+ current). When this threshold potential is exceeded, an action potential can be generated. The second stage is when depolarisation is sensed by voltage gated Na+ channels which activate and allow Na+ in, causing the cell to depolarise further. Therefore, a positive feedback loop is set up as depolarisation leads to more voltage gated Na+ channels opening, leading to more depolarisation.</p>\n<p>Following this, all Na+ channels open and the membrane potential approaches ENa; the membrane becomes more permeable to Na than K. At 40mv, Na+ channels shut automatically. It is important to realise that during this period, K+ channels have been slowly opening, allowing the positive charge out. K+ channels are voltage gated too but open slowly in response to depolarisation.\r\nAfter this, it follows that repolarisation occurs as K+ channels allow K+ efflux and Na+ channels are shut, bringing the membrane potential back towards Ek. Finally, some K+ channels close and the membrane stabilises at the resting membrane potential.</p>\n<p>However, the potential overshoots the resting level because K+ channels are also slow to close again on repolarisation. This is the hyperpolarisation period as the membrane potential is more negative than the resting potential.\r\nSo, what’s happening is that a negative feedback loop is taking place: depolarisation leads to an increase in permeability to K+ leading to an increase in K+ out, repolarising to counter depolarisation.</p>\n<h2>Propagation of the action potential</h2>\n<p>How are action potentials propagated? Action potentials are propagated by local currents along the membrane that change the voltage of neighbouring regions. When depolarisation occurs at one region of the axon, the current generated travels passively along the axon. Using our knowledge of the action potential, this spread of current depolarises adjacent regions of the membrane, opening some Na+ channels in the adjacent membrane. If the current is large enough, the depolarisation of the adjacent region will be large enough to exceed threshold potential. A positive feedback loop is set up leading to full depolarisation and initiating an action potential in the adjacent membrane regions. The depolarisation in turn generates currents which spread and depolarise the neighbouring region of membrane, and the cycle repeats. Eventually the signal travels down the axon and generates an action potential at the opposite end of the axon.</p>\n<p>Another important question to ask is how are action potentials propagated in one direction? The absolute refractory period occurs when Na+ channels are inactivated after they have just closed and will not open regardless of membrane potential and depolarisation, the Na+ channel will return to its active state after a period of time, ready to be activated when the membrane is depolarised. The relative refractory period occurs when the threshold potential is raised due to the reduced availability of active Na+ channels. Only some Na+ channels can be activated, thus a greater depolarisation is needed to generate a large enough inward Na+ current to balance the outward K+ current for threshold potential.</p>\n<p>These refractory periods allow the conduction of action potential in a singular direction. An action potential cannot be propagated backwards, only forwards. When an action potential is generated, the current generated can cause depolarisation of both the upstream and downstream adjacent regions. However as the upstream region will still be in a refractory period it is impossible or more difficult for an action potential to be generated due to the lack of Na+ channels available for activation.</p>\n<p>Similar in effect to the relative refractory period, K+ channels may still be open from the previous action potential in the upstream region. Thus the outward K+ current opposes the depolarisation experienced, reducing the effect of the Na+ current on membrane potential. The membrane upstream may still be hyperpolarised, so a much larger current is needed to bring the membrane potential up to the threshold potential.</p>\n<p>Overall the action potential generated is much more likely to only initiate another one in the downstream region where it is not in refractory period and the membrane is at resting potential. Na+ channels are active and ready to be activated. In this way, there is a one way propagation of the action potential down the axon!</p>\n<h2>The length constant</h2>\n<p>An important consideration when it comes to action potentials is the length constant.\r\nThe axoplasm has a high resistance, longitudinal resistance along the axon is too high. In contrast, cell membranes are poor resistors, and as a result transmembrane resistance across the membrane is too low. The result is that electrical current generated during an action potential leaks out of the axon as it travels through the axoplasm.This means voltage decays with distance from the action potential where initial depolarisation occurred. We define the length constant as the distance needed for the voltage to decrease to 37% of the initial voltage from the action potential. This describes the extent of leakage. In human axons the length constants are very small. Therefore the passive spread of current is unable to carry information over large distances.</p>\n<p>This is the very reason why action potentials exist and need to be constantly generated along the axon to allow for constant injection of currents so the signal (an action potential) can travel from one end of the axon to the other. An action potential also has to be propagated by a series of currents!</p>\n<h2>How can we speed up propagation of an action potential?</h2>\n<p>What affects the speed of propagation of an action potential? One logical way of speeding up propagation and making action potentials faster would be increasing the density of sodium channels. More channels represents a lower resistance and more current. But this is metabolically expensive as more sodium will need to be pumped out of the cell to active the action potential. What about increasing the length constant? This would allow currents to spread further along the axon; regions further from the active regions can be brought to threshold by passive current flow, speeding up the action potential. In theory, this could be done by decreasing longitudinal resistance or increasing transmembrane resistance. However, the things that determine longitudinal resistance (width and length of nerve and the intrinsic ionic composition of the nerve fibre itself) are not easy to change and are already optimised.</p>\n<p>A particularly well known adaptation of neurons is myelination- axons are wrapped repeatedly around by schwann cells (in PNS) or by oligodendrocytes (in CNS),  covering the axons with concentric layers of myelin. The myelin sheath increases transmembrane resistance, increasing the length constant. Thus less current can leak through the membrane and voltage decays less rapidly.  It is important to note that myelination increases length constant but does not change the intrinsic longitudinal resistance of the nerve itself.</p>\n<p>An additional note is that small-diameter myelinated nerve fibres conduct action potentials slower than unmyelinated fibres. This is because the axon of the myelinated fibre is too narrow causing the longitudinal resistance to be too great to conduct action potentials effectively. Hence small nerve fibres e.g. pain fibres are unmyelinated.</p>\n<div id=\"bibliography\">\r\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Anon, Luigi Galvani. Encyclopædia Britannica.

Introduction</h2>\n<p>Recent advances in medicine have led to the development of numerous devices that aid the detection of eye conditions such as glaucoma, macular degeneration and cataracts which are amongst the causes of reduced vision or even irreversible blindness. With age as the largest risk factor for most of the aforementioned conditions, screening the elderly at higher risk has become a common practice in the UK, allowing early detection and thus reducing complications or blindness.</p>\n<p>As mentioned by Glaucoma UK [1], glaucoma is the leading cause of blindness affecting over 700, 000 people in the UK of all ages. It is a chronic, neurodegenerative disease and is defined as the loss of retinal ganglion cells in the optic nerve of the eye, resulting in progressive loss of peripheral vision. The damage to the optic nerve head is due to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) as a result of unevenness between the production of aqueous humour (transparent fluid located in the eye) and the drainage system of the eye.</p>\n<h2>2. Development of Glaucoma</h2>\n<p>The aqueous humour, as shown in Figure 1, provides nutrients to the eye and maintains the eye pressure. It is produced by the ciliary body and flows to the anterior chamber where it is drained at the drainage angle. The reference of ‘angle’ is the angle between the cornea and iris. Amongst the various structures of the drainage angle, the most essential structure in the drainage of aqueous humour is the trabecular meshwork which is a spongy tissue with a sieve-like structure.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 407px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/1962a75e85d663686812284399285dbc/5bf10/Healthyeye.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 52.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Healthy eye\"\n        title=\"Healthy eye\"\n        src=\"/static/1962a75e85d663686812284399285dbc/5bf10/Healthyeye.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/1962a75e85d663686812284399285dbc/e07e9/Healthyeye.jpg 200w,\n/static/1962a75e85d663686812284399285dbc/066f9/Healthyeye.jpg 400w,\n/static/1962a75e85d663686812284399285dbc/5bf10/Healthyeye.jpg 407w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 407px) 100vw, 407px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<div class=\"centre\"><em>Figure 1 – Taken From Medirex Opticians [8]</em></div>\n<p>Following fluid drainage from the eye via the trabecular meshwork, the fluid flows through a structure called the Schlemm’s canal, into collector channels, veins and then eventually, back into the body’s circulatory system [3].</p>\n<p>A blockage in the drainage system restricts the flow of aqueous humour into the anterior chamber, resulting in increased pressure in the eye and eventually damaging the optic nerve. The optic nerve (also known as second cranial nerve) found at the back of the eye transfers visual information from the retina to the brain via electrical impulses [2]. The high pressure caused by inefficient drainage compresses the second cranial nerve resulting in cell death – this is called Glaucomatous optic atrophy.

If an individual has XFS, fibre-like substances existing outside of cells are deposited on ocular structures and throughout the body. The exact reason for XFS is unknown and hence, the mystery surrounding it means that the ultimate cause of glaucoma is still to be concluded.</p>\n<h2>3. Classifications of Glaucoma</h2>\n<p>There are several types of glaucoma, some include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Juvenile/adult Primary open-angle glaucoma</li>\n<li>Acute-angle closure glaucoma</li>\n<li>Secondary glaucoma</li>\n<li>Congenital glaucoma</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The most common type of glaucoma is primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). Anyone can develop POAG but there are some risk factors that may make individuals more susceptible to it. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Age\n<ul>\n<li>According to Glaucoma UK [6], it is estimated that about 2% of people aged 40+ have POAG, and this rises to almost 10% in people older than 75 (Glaucoma UK, n.d.).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ethnicity\n<ul>\n<li>Individuals with an African – Caribbean origin are at a higher risk of developing POAG compared to an individual with a European origin</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Family History\n<ul>\n<li>If your parents or sibling suffer from glaucoma, you are at a higher risk of developing POAG</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Myopia</li>\n<li>Corneal thickness</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Like most types of glaucoma, fluid is unable to be drained which leads to an increased eye pressure, damaging the second cranial nerve. Nevertheless, in POAG, a subgroup known as normal tension glaucoma (NTG), where the eye pressure is not very high, still damages the second cranial nerve. This may also be referred to as low tension glaucoma. Unlike most eye diseases, glaucoma does not show symptoms in early stages as there is no pain or drastic change in vision since the damage occurs in the peripheral parts of the vision.</p>\n<p>As mentioned, glaucoma left undetected can lead to devastating consequences such as irreversible blindness. So how can glaucoma be detected?</p>\n<h2>4. Detection of Glaucoma</h2>\n<p>After years of research and developments, there are now several modern computer-based machines that can be used to detect early signs of glaucoma. Some include the optical coherence tomography (OCT) machine and the fundoscopy machine.</p>\n<p>The OCT machine is a high-resolution imaging modality producing a cross-sectional tomographic (3-dimensional) image of the retina and evaluates the optic nerve. The use of long-wavelength and broad-bandwidth light sources to illuminate the retina enables it to assess the light reflected from the retinal tissues through the use of a spectrometer [4]. Additionally, it can indicate small changes in the thickness of the nerve fibre layers which gives early signs of glaucoma. Other than glaucoma, the OCT machine can also detect age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic macular oedema (DME), central serous chorioretinopathy (CSR) and many more diseases. A low image quality can often be caused by cataracts due to the blockage of light.</p>\n<p>In addition to the OCT machine, a fundoscopy machine can also be used to detect glaucoma. Like the OCT machine, it is a modern medical imaging technique that enables optometrists or ophthalmologists to detect changes in the optic disc and hence, glaucoma.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 449px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/a296acf1cfae2ecb6b2de426bc02765c/93dc1/Fundoscopy.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 55.49999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAALABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQAAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUBAgME/8QAFgEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgED/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAGkb8o1biko/8QAGxAAAwACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQREzP/2gAIAQEAAQUCr7RoFsdyQyijtE1xkXn/xAAXEQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEh/9oACAEDAQE/AV5OX//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARIf/aAAgBAgEBPwGNf//EABwQAAIBBQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAhAxQWJxkf/aAAgBAQAGPwKb2FJ2M+Eu1//EABoQAQADAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESFRMZH/2gAIAQEAAT8hMRtMDgNxmmTLb3uE2m66x3l+s//aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQgD//xAAXEQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABFB/9oACAEDAQE/EAAHQgXL/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAR/9oACAECAQE/EB6rCi//xAAcEAEAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABESEAYTFBUfD/2gAIAQEAAT8QhQ0WLrjLHRSCkiSvclvM8eP47NtbwIJdvFZvJ4sx9Xn/2Q=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Fundoscopy\"\n        title=\"Fundoscopy\"\n        src=\"/static/a296acf1cfae2ecb6b2de426bc02765c/93dc1/Fundoscopy.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/a296acf1cfae2ecb6b2de426bc02765c/e07e9/Fundoscopy.jpg 200w,\n/static/a296acf1cfae2ecb6b2de426bc02765c/066f9/Fundoscopy.jpg 400w,\n/static/a296acf1cfae2ecb6b2de426bc02765c/93dc1/Fundoscopy.jpg 449w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<div class=\"centre\"><em>Figure 3 – Fundoscopy Pictures From Hindawi Journal Comparing Optic Disc Without and With Glaucoma [5]</em></div>\n<h2>5. Treatment of Glaucoma</h2>\n<p>Although there are no available treatments to regain vision that has been lost, eye drops such as betaxolol hydrochloride (Betoptic S) and metipranolol (Optipranolol) have been made available to those suffering from glaucoma. These are beta blockers which reduces the production of fluid released from the eye. Prostaglandins such as latanoprost (Xalatan) are other forms of eye drops that improve the drainage of the fluid in the eye to reduce ocular hypertension. Other forms of treatments include laser procedures and surgery. Nevertheless, there is still room for further developments of treatments such as gene therapies to prevent more prevalent ocular diseases such as POAG and its eventual testing in humans. Despite ongoing research on how gene therapies may prevent POAG, Luxturna, a form of gene therapy, has been known to treat congenital blindness (another classification of glaucoma) which is a seminal accomplishment.</p>\n<h2>6. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Having said that, it is important to remember that these non-invasive treatments do not cure glaucoma, but instead it controls the intraocular pressure in the eye and prevents damage to the optic nerve. Hence it is vital to regularly attend eye check-ups, especially with a family history of glaucoma or other eye conditions.</p>\n<p>Don’t forget: Prevention is better than cure. </p>\n<div id=\"bibliography\">\r\n<h2>7.

California. On a morning radio show, an excruciating contest was going on. Named 'Hold your wee for a Wii' [1][3] by the now-defunct KDND radio station, 18 contestants were downing bottles of water one after the other, on the condition that whoever could drink the most while not urinating would win a Nintendo Wii gaming console as a prize. Contestants agonizingly crammed down mouthfuls of liquid down their throats, while the hosts egged them on with gleeful laughter. As time ticked by, some could no longer endure such an ordeal, dropping out in the middle and probably wondering why they had signed up to such a torturous session. “She looks like she’s pregnant,” sniggered one of the DJs, pointing to a female participant with an overwhelmingly bloated stomach. Little did they know, she would be dead in a few hours.</p>\n<p>Jennifer Strange, 28, had passed away from overhydration, by literally drinking much more water than her body could handle.</p>\n<p>While it’s “common sense” that the overconsumption of pretty much any substance can lead to some unpleasant repercussions, the exact science behind it isn’t so straightforward. In this article, I will attempt to break down the mechanism of water poisoning in simple layman’s terms.</p>\n<p>When excessive amounts of water are consumed in a short period of time, the kidneys, the organs responsible for filtering waste out of your body fluids, simply cannot work fast enough. Liters of water are now circulating throughout the bloodstream, diluting blood to a large extent. This means that there is a very high concentration of water molecules outside of the cells. In contrast, the fluid inside human cells consists of a wide array of substances, with potassium, magnesium and sulfate ions just to name a few. Hence, at this point, the concentration of water molecules is lower inside the cell than outside (it isn’t as diluted)</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 624px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/39a3b677823525d41d5f41efb1ad8209/39c09/osmosis.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 61%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAMCAYAAABiDJ37AAAACXBIWXMAAA7DAAAOwwHHb6hkAAACFklEQVQoz22SzW7TQBSF87pIbBAvAFskHgF28AJdsSgU0UpJUwIlVStE/hr/JU7iOLbnz/b4Q7abkKqMdGTN+Nwz5547HYCqqjj+buOYyWSC7/vM7u+ZzWY4rttAG0NlLaW1WMC2JYfVqUX2QjVJSEOaKaJtQrzLSDPBar1hNJ6ySzJUXhLnoJVBzx1EvENpg5SSsiz/CdYoyhKlCoqiamCMRWuLEDnz+RKTg4pSzM0tJAnm+TN0HDMPFvS6XcJwRefYrq2qpljKog6ANDVtBFvBZBy0nOkE8/IFNUMPrlGvX1G2eTWmOtZahsMhruuilGG1zkgS0wjXbtM0J8s0s0nQiNSreP8OHSzRizX65ORwTvWQ4Xq9blDntd3Kh7YtxpSteCqYbzLkp1PM2zfIDx+xntfmXl9QlIehPmlZKXvYC9ESd7Fk6kXg+jD4jto7NRaR6WaYB8HjodTw/BDXW+B5AffzBa7nMXcCoigmVhovTvAcF98P8IOQVOjGyBOH+6czHP7i2/k5FxcXdLtdbm5uiaJt82/8Z8SX08+cnX3lstdnNp1hjHlU39lv9gdKSqTMUEqQ5/rRo42iFaPRbzzPIc8VQqQURcGxxpHDdkx1HEkCm03JapWzXCrC0BCGuoHvCzabgtp0zTt291+HUlY4Dlz/XHJ15dHvuwwGC/qXLj9+LOn1HO7utkynMB5XjYm6dN/yX+avlScmqKWYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Osmosis\"\n        title=\"Osmosis\"\n        src=\"/static/39a3b677823525d41d5f41efb1ad8209/39c09/osmosis.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/39a3b677823525d41d5f41efb1ad8209/772e8/osmosis.png 200w,\n/static/39a3b677823525d41d5f41efb1ad8209/e17e5/osmosis.png 400w,\n/static/39a3b677823525d41d5f41efb1ad8209/39c09/osmosis.png 624w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<div class=\"centre\"><em>A diagram that demonstrates the process of osmosis, using sucrose and water as examples.</em></div>\n<p>And this is when the principle of osmosis comes into play. For those who may not be aware, osmosis is when solvent molecules naturally diffuse from an area of high to low concentration across a semi-permeable membrane. For the sake of argument, let’s say that across such a membrane there are two sides, one with 100% water and the other side with 50% water. In this case, we would see water moving into the side with less water molecules (i.e., the 50% side). To visualize this phenomenon easily, try placing a dried raisin into water. Overtime, it will slowly expand in size as it absorbs water from its surroundings. Why? Because the inside of a raisin has less water than the outside, and by osmosis water will go in. The same applies to human cells. With much more water present in blood, they are taken up by cells which swell up massively to accommodate more liquid.</p>\n<p>Swelling cells isn’t that big of an issue for many parts of your body, but that doesn’t apply to the brain. Enclosed tightly inside the skull cavity, brain cells simply have no room to expand. What then occurs is the swollen brain tightly pressing against the sides of the skull, leading to headaches, one of the first symptoms to be observed, accompanied with nausea and mental disorientation. The heavy pressure also obstructs blood flow, leading to chances of seizures or the victim simply falling unconscious. This phenomenon, cerebral edema, is known to be a major cause of strokes and traumatic brain injuries.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 624px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/2928b30c1b0a7253ab8f422568b85497/a3695/Cerebraledema.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 111.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Cerebral edema\"\n        title=\"Cerebral edema\"\n        src=\"/static/2928b30c1b0a7253ab8f422568b85497/a3695/Cerebraledema.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/2928b30c1b0a7253ab8f422568b85497/e07e9/Cerebraledema.jpg 200w,\n/static/2928b30c1b0a7253ab8f422568b85497/066f9/Cerebraledema.jpg 400w,\n/static/2928b30c1b0a7253ab8f422568b85497/a3695/Cerebraledema.jpg 624w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<div class=\"centre\">MRI Scan of a brain affected by cerebral edema [2]</em></div>\n<p>One prominent risk factor that increases the risk of overhydration is heavy sweating and physical activity, when one is more prone to drinking an excessive amount of water unknowingly. Marathon runners are particularly susceptible, with a 2005 study [4] showing that 13% of Boston Marathon participants ended up with hyponatremia (low sodium concentration in blood), a symptom of overhydration. The researchers concluded that this was linked to “consumption of more than 3 liters of fluid during the race”. In a separate investigation by the American armed forces [5], three soldier deaths attributed to water intoxication were uncovered, where the water intakes of the victims “reached 5 liters, usually 10-20 liters in just a few hours”.</p>\n<p>And what can be done about this? In serious cases, diuretics, a class of drugs that increases urine production, can be administered to get rid of excess water quicker. A second treatment involves the use of VRAs, substances that interfere with the hormone vasopressin at its receptors. This hormone instructs the kidney to conserve more water, and by inhibiting its action, urine volume is increased.</p>\n<p>If you’re feeling ever so slightly uneasy having read to this point, please do not be concerned. Healthy human kidneys can process around 1L of water (Approx. 4 average-sized glasses) per hour, and in many cases the condition is relatively mild where no significant symptoms are noticed. Considering that the commonly said “8 glasses of water per day” only amounts to around 2-3L, there should be zero concern for overhydration as long as you’re not guzzling more than half of your daily water intake in a single sitting.</p>\n<div id=\"bibliography\">\r\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Anon, 2007.

Bits and pieces of economic theory have been mentioned by the Ancient Greeks but in the late 1700s, modern economics came into existence as its own subject, gaining lots of traction until it became one of the most important social sciences in use today.</p>\n<p>Neoclassical economics is, broadly speaking, the theory that focuses on demand and supply; the most important determinants of the production, consumption and market price of goods and services. This was revolutionary, as in the 1900s, it changed many economists’ views and influenced classical theory, where costs of production was the most important factor for the market price of goods and services, among other ideas. Nowadays, when we think of economics, our brain goes straight to supply and demand, demonstrating the impact that Neoclassical economics has had on our views. But it’s not only just our views, but our real world actions; our implementation of policy and how we run our businesses. But the Neoclassical theory has been around for a relatively long time from the birth of economics, and makes many assumptions, some of which aren’t completely in line with our world today. This creates some problems when trying to implement this theory; And that’s where Behavioural economics comes in.</p>\n<p>Neoclassical economists believe in economic rationality. In theory, consumers always maximise their utility, or firms aim to maximise their long term profit, but there’s so much more to it. When it came to how and why consumers make decisions, Neoclassical economics came up with a few principles, which together make up rational choice.</p>\n<p>One axiom of this theory is that consumers process the information of an economic decision objectively and are not subject to framing manipulation, having fixed preferences.</p>\n<p>Another assumption is that consumer preferences are complete, which means that the consumer will have a preference, and when presented with two goods will be able to say which they like better, or will be completely indifferent. They will not be undecided or get confused on which one to buy, they will either pick one, the other, or neither, and not for the sake of it.</p>\n<p>The third, and possibly most famous, idea of rational choice is the Substitution axiom. It argues that if a consumer has no preference between two goods, then the consumer would be indifferent between two lotteries with those two goods as their prizes. Now this axiom further states that if something identical is removed from those two goods, the consumers would still have the same preference between them; known as the cancellation principle.</p>\n<p>Neoclassical economics has so many rules and principles regarding consumer choice and rationality, and after describing a few of them one may question how Behavioural economics ties into any of this. Well, Behavioural economics revolves around the fact that consumers are not rational, and how they can potentially be manipulated into making certain decisions - decisions that consumers think they are making all on their own.</p>\n<p>As with most parts of economics, Behavioural economics can be traced back to Adam Smith in the 1700s, who knew that people are overconfident and often overestimate their abilities, which are concepts that can be found in Behavioural economics today. However, it was much later, in the 1980s, when this came into fruition. Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman were very active psychologists during this time, identifying key concepts of Behavioural economics, and setting the foundation for future economists to build upon. Most famously, they found that people are subject to framing manipulations, with a theory they called “Prospect theory”.</p>\n<p>For example, most would choose to win £250 guaranteed rather than gamble on a 25% chance of winning £1000 and a 75% chance of winning nothing. However, if presented with the chance to lose £750 guaranteed or a 75% chance to lose £1000 and a 25% chance to lose nothing, most people will risk losing £1000, hoping to lose nothing. What this shows is that people are more likely to take on the risk when trying to avoid a loss rather than gain a profit, which contradicts utility theory.</p>\n<p>In the 1980s, Richard Thaler began collaborating with Tversky and Kahneman, and further built upon this work. It was around this period of time where Behavioural economics is said to have properly been created, and Thaler was credited with being its founder, later earning him a Nobel prize in Economic Sciences in 2017. Thaler built the base of Behavioural economics, most famously writing a book in 2008 about the concept of a “nudge”. This concept of a nudge, a way to influence the behaviour of an individual, is now synonymous with Behavioural economics, and it’s all thanks to Thaler.</p>\n<p>Looking at real life examples we can see why neoclassical theories may be wrong when it comes to rationality, and Behavioural economics can, to some extent, explain why people do what they do. But Behavioural economics can also be used to help solve market failure. Market failure is where the market doesn’t deliver an efficient allocation of resources; goods are being over/under produced. This is against neoclassical theory as it is stated that markets will reach allocative efficiency, through the power of the “invisible hand”, and when market failure occurs regulation is typically the answer. However, as with any economic decision, there are opportunity costs, for example for the regulation to be effective monitoring and policing is needed. Additionally, bans could lead to illegal activity and regulation could also reduce consumer choice. And this is where the concept of the “nudge” becomes very useful.</p>\n<p>In Thalers’ book he sets up a scene of a school cafeteria, and Carolyn, the director for food services, is trying to influence the decisions that the children make, without using typical measures like banning specific foods or likewise. She found that by placing certain foods at eye level, or making separate queues for desserts and main meals, she could increase or decrease the consumption of many food items by up to 25%. These simple small changes can be used to reduce market failure to a certain extent, and with potentially smaller opportunity costs.</p>\n<p>However, while this may be used to reduce market failure it can also be used to achieve the opposite. Firms use many ideas of Behavioural economics when making decisions. For example, the concept of the default choice is continually used. Research shows that humans rarely deviate from the default choice, the option that is selected if the consumer selects nothing. Even if people are aware of a change to the default settings or can choose between the default option and another options, many people choose to stick with the default. This is exploited by firms, as if they find any one policy or such gives a better outcome for them, they will simply make it the default.</p>\n<p>Another example of how firms use loss aversion to sell is quite commonly found on online shopping sites. Loss aversion is the idea that people dislike losing more than they enjoy winning, meaning they would choose much lower risk options, even if it means drastically reducing the reward, and this can be seen in the Prospect theory example we covered earlier. Shopping sites use phrases like “There’s only one left”, “Limited stock” or “Selling out quickly”, creating a sense of urgency and also fear of missing out. Loss aversion can also apply to social norms, and people trying to not lose in the sense of fitting in. If items are appearing to sell out quickly the risks of not buying are seemingly more than the risk of buying, rushing people to the checkout.</p>\n<p>Looking at Behavioural economics on a surface level, it may seem like the solution to all of neoclassicals problems in microeconomics, as it stems from the fact that people don’t always make choices in their best interests, which is entirely what neoclassical theory is based on. However, the rise of Behavioural economics, while having solved problems, has also created problems. It is as writer and philosopher Robert Pirsig says: “every answer leads to ten more questions”. With the discovery of nudges and choice architecture, how the environment of the decision can be used to influence the decision, we realise that all of our decisions, whether intended or not, were made with us being nudged in some direction. And with that we realise that it is impossible to not influence peoples’ decisions, and that there is no such thing as a neutral layout, because it is still a layout.</p>\n<p>Finally, Behavioural economics is still a relatively new concept, and while 2008 may seem like a long time ago, there is still further to go until Behavioural economics will be able to make as much of an impact as neoclassical economics. Additionally, schools of thought such as Keynesian and neuro-economics have helped to make our understanding and practice of economics more informed. Our world is extremely complex, with there being so much that we don’t understand. Behavioural economics models should be used as a tool, alongside Neoclassical and Keynesian models, to help us make some sense of how our economy works, and what we should do to improve it.</p>\n<div id=\"bibliography\">\r\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Beggs, Jodi., ThoughtCo. 2022.

High pressure pushes air to the surface, as it prevents it from rising, creating increased temperatures through compression. When sufficient levels of each have been reached, a fire starts. Unfortunately, a heat dome also causes drought, which dries up the grass and provides more than enough fuel for a fire to start. Finally, oxygen is needed to stoke the fire and cause it to grow. These three elements - heat, oxygen and fuel - form the fire triangle.</p>\n<p>Something still needs to ignite the fire, however. Natural causes, such as lightning, sparks from rockfall, volcanic eruptions and spontaneous combustion, can all start wildfires. Wildfires have been natural occurrences for approximately 419 million years, and their presence has had evolutionary effects on most ecosystems’ plants and animals. Humans have also got ways of igniting fires, from sparks off machinery, power lines and trains, as well as people deliberately starting fires, either through arson, mistakes (like a smouldering cigarette or barbeque) or slash-and-burn (where a section of forest is razed to make way for construction). Preventing all these causes is futile, as there are far too many occurrences worldwide to stop them all, especially as a result of global warming, which makes the circumstances for fires more common, and increasing the amount of fires worldwide.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most interesting cause of ignition is spontaneous combustion. A flashpoint is when all three points of the fire triangle are present, and something ignites the fire. Flashpoints can be reached in other high-pressure, low water level areas too, such as compost bins, turning what was once innocuous into a ticking time bomb, should the temperature ever increase to the point where the compost bin self-ignites. In Canada, there is a common type of tree - the Ponderosa pine. The high sap content is an evolutionary advantage of the Ponderosa, as it allowed the tree to survive the fire season. However, global warming is increasing the temperature and causing the sap to evaporate. Without the liquid in the sap, the wood reaches a flashpoint and self-ignites.</p>\n<p>When visiting Canada, on two occasions I was subject to some wildfires, likely caused by the Ponderosa pine self-igniting. Recently I drove through the small town of Lytton, which had been caught in the path of a fire and had burnt to the ground in 2021 - 90% of the town was destroyed, and over 2,000 people were affected. In Canada, most houses are constructed out of wood, due to their significant lumber industry, and Lytton was no different, facilitating the high destruction rate. The government had put barriers up to prevent onlookers, but through cracks I could see brown grass on black soil, and the outlines of roads and houses. Seeing the aftereffects of a wildfire was quite shocking, as most of the 6 hour drive north was accompanied by charred trunks and brown grass. At one point, I thought a mountain had snow on the top, which I thought was unlikely in July. I was corrected - the fires had burnt all the vegetation away, exposing the raw stone underneath.</p>\n<p>The second time was significantly scarier. In 2017, Canada had one of its worst wildfire seasons in recent years, and I was right in the middle of one of these wildfires. Imagine looking out of the windscreen and seeing only 30 metres in front of you. With a few cats eyes on the road to guide us through the wall of smoke that reached so high the sky was tinged red due to all the light from the fire, it was difficult to see where to go, and our speed was reduced to a fraction of what it should be on a freeway. It was quite an experience, and the smoke from the fire reached all the way south to Vancouver, the largest city in British Columbia.</p>\n<p>Now imagine how dangerous an undetectable fire could be. Detection methods on a large scale or in a rural area consist of firewatch towers and satellite images, which, naturally, cannot detect underground fires. Coal seam fires and root fires both travel, undetected, underground, for up to hundreds of miles. Fires may be put out on the surface, but can reappear days later when a root fire travels upward through a tree trunk or a coal seam fire comes too close to the surface. These kinds of fires are rare, but are inherently dangerous, as the short time to react means they can cause extreme damage, both short-term and long-term.</p>\n<p>Starting by taking a look at the short-term effects, wildfires suck cold air down as hot air rises, due to the pressure differences created, which feeds the fire with oxygen and ensures it keeps going. This movement of air also creates wind, which can blow the fire at speeds of up to 6.7mph in dense forests and 14mph in grasslands, a danger for anything in the path, and sometimes outrunning evacuation efforts, as in Lytton, where sadly two inhabitants of the town died. The damages can prove costly, especially for weaker economies that cannot deal with the long-term rebuilding costs. The Lytton fire has cost US$150 million (as of October 2021), and the town is still not rebuilt, meaning the 2,000+ people affected are still displaced.</p>\n<div class=\"image-card-left\">\n    <div class=\"image\">\n        <div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 544px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/aca38656a0364f8c859f643d96b5ced5/b3e51/Saopaulo.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 82%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Sao Paulo\" title=\"Sao Paulo\" src=\"/static/aca38656a0364f8c859f643d96b5ced5/b3e51/Saopaulo.png\" srcset=\"/static/aca38656a0364f8c859f643d96b5ced5/772e8/Saopaulo.png 200w,\n/static/aca38656a0364f8c859f643d96b5ced5/e17e5/Saopaulo.png 400w,\n/static/aca38656a0364f8c859f643d96b5ced5/b3e51/Saopaulo.png 544w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div>\n        <em>São Paulo, cloaked in smoke in 2019.</em>\n    </div>\n    <p>Smoke is also an issue, both short and long-term. Short-term, it can lower visibility and prevent effective evacuation and medical assistance. In Canada, where distances are vast and terrain is vertical due to the Rocky Mountains, helicopters are used to rescue people trapped. However, smoke obscures vision and makes flight incredibly difficult. Smoke can be carried by the wind and blown many miles away, such as the August 2019 Amazon wildfires in Bolivia, where the wind carried smoke over 900 miles to São Paulo in Brazil, engulfing the city in darkness in the middle of the day. The smoke also brought much lower air quality, affecting those with breathing problems especially badly, and lowered visibility to the point where basic travel became much more difficult to achieve, preventing people from going to work or visiting those affected by the smoke. If allowed to enter a building or other enclosed space, the smoke can also cause carbon monoxide poisoning too.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Smoke will clear after a short period of time, and houses can be rebuilt. Long-term effects are much trickier to deal with. Wildfires are a negative feedback loop - this means the effects from wildfires cause an increase in wildfires. Trees contain absorbed carbon from the atmosphere, and act as carbon sinks. They retain this carbon for years until they die, and a trees’ age is usually in the triple-digit range. When trees die, they release some of this carbon into the ground as it decomposes, and a small amount returns back to the atmosphere. When a tree burns in a wildfire, the carbon isn’t lost through decomposition. Instead, almost all of the absorbed carbon returns to the atmosphere. This helps the enhanced greenhouse effect, where gases like carbon dioxide trap heat from the Sun by scattering the rays and preventing some of the rays from reflecting off the Earth and going back out into space, increasing the temperature of the planet, and increasing the risk of wildfires.</p>\n<p>WIldfires, naturally, cause environmental damage, especially when multiple bad wildfire seasons follow one another, leaving no time for the environment to recover. Given time, a habitat can spring back in just a few years, as plants have adapted to live with wildfires. Sequoia trees, for example, rely on fires to reduce competition for water, nutrients and sunlight, to release seeds from their cones and to clear the ground, ready for new growth. New growth cannot happen, however, if  the frequency of wildfires increases, preventing those species adapted to live with wildfires to deal with the increase in intensity and frequency caused by climate change. If plants that have adapted to live with fires can’t cope, the effect in areas with plants that haven’t adapted to deal with fires will leave longer-lasting damage. Climate change also increases the reach of wildfires, away from the equator and tropics, increasing the amount of regions that will experience fires. Most of Europe falls into this category.</p>\n<p>So, how will Europe cope with this new threat? There are many ways to detect wildfires, and many ways to put them out, but few ways to prevent them.One of the few ways is to warn or ban ignition culprits like barbeques and smoking in wooded or grassy areas, as well as educating users of these spaces to the dangers of left-over smouldering litter. Detection methods are going to need to be adopted too. Large-scale methods like firewatch towers or satellite imagery are relatively simple to implement, but limited in their ability to detect smaller fires. They are also reactionary, meaning the fire will have had time to grow and spread before it is detected, which gives the fire a chance to grow larger or do some damage before it is noticed. Smaller-scale detection methods include remote sensors, which will be useful in high-value locations, such as population centres or wildlife preserves. This method can detect fires before they are given a chance to grow large and deal significant damage, but is costly to implement, limiting its large-scale effectiveness. Finally, weather data can be used to try and predict when wildfires have the highest chance of occurring, allowing wildfire detection methods to be put on high alert. However, as the recent heatwave has shown, changing weather over short periods of time can be exacerbated by climate change, changing rapidly from year to year, meaning estimates may not be as accurate as they would be otherwise and limiting the effectiveness of using weather data to make predictions. Additionally, due to this rapid changing, archival data is less accurate and prevents the accuracy of these predictions, as predictions are drawn from a smaller data set.</p>\n<div class=\"image-card-right\">\n    <p>As wildfires prove inevitable in the face of difficult prevention methods and limited detection methods, effective methods of extinguishing the flames will be needed in the future. A common sight in wildfires, especially in countries with large areas of affected land, is the water bomber. These planes scoop up water from lakes and rivers, and drop them over the fires to extinguish them. Effective in rural locations and for large fires, but difficult to use if no water source is nearby and can create havoc if thousands of litres of water is dropped over an urban area. Their effectiveness in rural areas is due to their ability to hold up to 74,000 litres of water, although most bombers carry much less than the 747 Supertanker, which set the record for largest rated capacity in a water bomber. The Russian Beriyev Be-200, pictured below fighting fires in Israel in 2010, can carry 12,000 litres.</p>\n    <div class=\"image\">\n        <div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative;

These generally consist of lakes, wide rivers, roads (generally motorways, although it can be smaller roads too) and areas of little vegetation. These barriers prove effective if wide enough and if the fire is small enough, however overhanging fauna or large fires can cross these barriers, making them only marginally effective. The most effective prevention method, especially in urban areas, are firefighters on the ground, who have been trained to deal with large-scale urban fires or wildfires. Combined efforts from the water bombers to extinguish large areas and firefighters on the ground to attack the smaller flames the plane did not catch are the best ways to deal with these large fires.</p>\n</div>\n<p>To recap, wildfires are increasing in range, frequency and are becoming more extreme. At the same time, we are becoming more able to detect and prevent the spread of wildfires, through new technologies, such as new prediction models based on simulated weather forecasts in the future, allowing us to be even more accurate in predicting when and where wildfires are most likely to occur.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, if any lesson is to be learnt here, it's that wildfires are not to be taken lightly, and will continue to be a threat now and in the future, and we must learn to adapt and mitigate their effects as they change over time. Recently, one example of this is the European firefighters working together in Bordeaux to fight the ”monster” fires, sharing their knowledge as other countries that suffer from fires more frequently have deployed firefighters in France. This kind of coordination and teamwork is vital in adapting to cope with fires in areas where they have been absent until now, as it will become a more common occurrence as our world heats up due to climate change.</p>","frontmatter":{"type":"Article","first_name":null,"surname":null,"school":null,"pronouns":null,"role":null,"slug":"/articles/6","profile_picture":null,"title":"Wildfires, and how they are affected by climate change","composer":null,"subject":"C8792C","userID":null,"articleID":"6","userIDs":["o"],"preview_image":"wildfires1.jpg","issue":1}},{"html":"<p>Since 2014, with all factors being equal, the annual inflation growth rate on the transfer market for the top 5 league footballers has been 26%.

For most large clubs, match day sales are mostly fixed with little fluctuation since they sell out most to all their stadium. On the other hand, the other 3 factors are massively dependent on the success of the team and their overall popularity. Sponsorships tend to also be driven by the reputation and success, where more notable and prestigious teams land higher value sponsorships; Liverpool FC’s deal with their defining sponsor Standard Chartered, a British bank, is rumoured to be worth around $59.2 million a year2. Commercial sales are a weird mix of popularity and success, for example Man United have recently been underperforming largely but have no doubt been constantly selling shirts and tickets due to strong fan loyalty. TV revenue is also determined by several ways differing by league/tournament, the Premier League for example determines the final allocation of TV money by league position, how many games were shown by the team and also by the pool of money generated from selling the rights domestically and overseas.</p>\n<p>Overall, 3 of these income streams can be maximised by having the best possible team and players. Franchise players can significantly help considering that many of these players come from countries with a large domestic market or fanbase; in 2019 Juventus signed Ronaldo for a fee of approximately £105 million, but his shirt sales alone reportedly earnt around $60 million in just the first 24 hours3 on top of the huge digital impact shown by the graph, proving how significant the ROI was associated with this transfer. It would be fair to expect the value of these franchise players to increase even further as more developing countries begin to participate more as global consumers of the games.</p>\n<p>Another reason that accelerated increases in the value of transfers is due to a crazy transfer involving Neymar Jr, a Brazilian Prodigy. This all stems back to 2013, with Neymar joining Barcelona from Brazilian club Santos for a substantial but well reasonable fee of £49m4. Barcelona set his release clause at €222 million, which at the time seemed more than enough to put off any rational sporting investors, but PSG are not a rational club and in 2017 decided to break the transfer record by signing Neymar for this absurd fee. This sent the market for high tier football players into a vigorous spiral, with the first domino effects being seen in Spain where €1bn release clauses in renewed contracts have started to become more common with the top 4 teams. Desperate to replace Neymar with this huge sum of cash, Barcelona’s first mistake was to purchase Ousmane Dembele for €105 million from Dortmund where he was injury plagued and only scored 19 goals in 102 games. Disappointed with his performance, and also needing to replace Iniesta, Barcelona spent a further £120 million on Coutinho from Liverpool who performed even worse and ended up being loaned out. Within 6 months, all the money that Barcelona had received was gone, both players signed did not live up to expectations, causing it to anger fans and lead to substantially less revenue being generated compared to what was expected, whilst causing every other decent attacker’s value to be inflated by a huge margin, such as Joao Felix for £114 million and Jack Grealish for £110 million. There was also a surge in the number of free transfers; as more and more players were denied transfers to new clubs due to ridiculous valuations, many just started running down the time on their contracts and leaving like Pogba with Manchester United, Rudiger and Alaba with Real Madrid and Messi with PSG.</p>\n<p>In general, it has been much more common to see higher than ever price tags being slapped onto even the most mediocre of talents, but this is not surprising in a highly competitive industry with highly profit maximising clubs that will take every opportunity to squeeze money out of their rivals and fans. With more clubs seeing the potential of franchise players to help their finances and the fall of an old generation of players, there is even more demand for new football superstars for young fans to idolise, support and financially contribute towards as they grow up.</p>\n<div id=\"bibliography\">\r\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://football-observatory.com/IMG/sites/mr/mr47/en/\">https://football-observatory.com/IMG/sites/mr/mr47/en/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/liverpool-standard-chartered-shirt-sponsorship-extension-premier-league/\">https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/liverpool-standard-chartered-shirt-sponsorship-extension-premier-league/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/18/juventus-sold-over-60-million-of-ronaldo-jerseys-in-just-one-day.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/18/juventus-sold-over-60-million-of-ronaldo-jerseys-in-just-one-day.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22760770\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22760770</a></li>\n</ol>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"type":"Article","first_name":null,"surname":null,"school":null,"pronouns":null,"role":null,"slug":"/articles/18","profile_picture":null,"title":"The Economics behind football player prices","composer":null,"subject":"BFAA34","userID":null,"articleID":"18","userIDs":["aa"],"preview_image":"economics1.jpg","issue":1}},{"html":"<p>The isekai genre remains one of the most popular genres in web novels, light novels, manga and anime. As of August 2022, Anime Planet lists over 205 anime as having the isekai tag; over 1877 manga as having the isekai tag; and novel updates lists over 2100 light, web or published novels as having at least one of the following tags: transported to another world; transported into a game world; reincarnated in another world; and reincarnated in a game world.  The origin of the isekai can be traced to the Japanese folk tale of Urashima Tarō, who saves a turtle and is brought into a magical undersea kingdom. After spending what he thinks is 4-5 days there, he returns to his home, only to find that 300 years have passed1. That is what an isekai is: it is speculative fiction (fiction that incorporates elements not grounded in reality, recorded history or our universe) in which one or more protagonists are transported (usually through being summoned or dying and then reincarnating) into another world. From there anything can happen as the very nature of the setting allows the author to do whatever they want.  The term isekai itself (meaning “other world” or “different world” in Japanese) was used sporadically until 20132, after which a substantial increase in searches can be observed (see fig 1).</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 624px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/9926b958d5e093a6ef35ebc84c73552a/39c09/trend.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 27.500000000000004%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAGCAYAAADDl76dAAAACXBIWXMAAA7DAAAOwwHHb6hkAAAAtElEQVQY05WQzW7DMAyD/f6v2MtO7YD1J3XiOpZIcbCTQzpghxL4AFqiZMMp56xSigCoKyI+psvM1FpT0q7/gp8uTiRFhnhocMfc5e46ZroHuS94J69QUm/8Rdtt+Tmp1vo+GBTchp8qB3mlzjN1ujalpUHFQsU4eFloXql7cT1e0FShn8UH/Xwrruvi+p6hr4frMmNkS4NIKJlDCAmMjZB6bTXIGQPDRtvr3ffs8dUExjf8AlKE2Tz0+PmPAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Google trend\"\n        title=\"Google trend\"\n        src=\"/static/9926b958d5e093a6ef35ebc84c73552a/39c09/trend.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/9926b958d5e093a6ef35ebc84c73552a/772e8/trend.png 200w,\n/static/9926b958d5e093a6ef35ebc84c73552a/e17e5/trend.png 400w,\n/static/9926b958d5e093a6ef35ebc84c73552a/39c09/trend.png 624w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<div class=\"centre\"><em>Fig 1.

Azuma’s grand nonnarrative suggests that there is no grand narrative but instead all stories consist of tropes and clichés from a canonical pool of such recognisable to the reader. This collection of tropes and clichés is the so-called grand nonnarrative4. It is blindingly evident how this applies to modern isekai. After all, they all feature one or more protagonists being transported one way or another to another world or setting; a lot of them receive new skills or “cheat abilities” (read legally distinct plot armour); and usually there is magic and monsters. More niche tropes include the “game system” (where the world the story takes place has a system similar to that of role-playing games that has a level up mechanic etc); the death-by-truck-leads-to-reincarnation, which has spawned the meme of “truck-kun”; and more fantastical elements like the adventurers’ guild or the summoned protagonist(s) being chosen hero(es) and whatnot. Dr Paul Price, in his essay “A Survey of Story Elements of Isekai Manga” asserts that these stories “have no higher meaning other than they are created with the elements and characteristics that come from the grand nonnarrative”. Whilst this can be seen to be true with <strong>a lot</strong> (and I mean the vast majority of isekais you read), it obviously does not apply to all isekai stories and there are some that subvert certain clichés and tropes to great effect but it then poses an interesting question: is it (the story) still part of the grand nonnarrative if it uses elements not part of the so-called canon? Or rather, if a subversion of an isekai trope (such as the protagonist being summoned to another world to be their saviour) is successful the first time (turns out the protagonist was mistakenly summoned alongside the saviour and is unwanted!) and then is copied ad nauseum by other prospective isekai stories, at what point does the subversion of the trope/cliché become one itself and become a part of the grand nonnarrative canon? Also, what even defines the canon of the grand nonnarrative? Is it merely just elements and characteristics of stories that are instantly recognisable to the reader? If so, isn’t everyone’s reading experience different?</p>\n<p>With such confusing queries, it does seem that the isekai genre itself can offer a solution, or rather, the start to one. After all, isekai by the very nature of its being and creation is recognisable. Does your story involve being transported to another world? Isekai. Does your story not involve being transported to another world? Not an isekai. But is that really all that makes up an isekai? No matter how many tropes you tack on to your story, without the crucial “character is transported to another world”, your story is not an isekai. So is that it? Is being transported to another world the only characteristic of an isekai story necessary for it to be called an isekai? Yes, it appears to be and that is why isekai is such a popular genre.</p>\n<p>The thing with isekai is that the otherworld can be whatever the author wants it to be. As such, you can tailor any other genre to also be an isekai. Do you want some magic in your slice of life romantic comedy? Boom, make it an isekai. Do you want your coming-of-age story to happen in an interesting setting and not Earth? Boom, make it an isekai. Do you want to exposit all the cool and exciting lore of your magical world but can’t think of a way to do it subtly and/or naturally? Boom, make it an isekai so your clueless, out-of-this-world (literally) protagonist acts as the perfect catalyst for any exposition dumps you want to do to slow down the plot! With so much variety and with how saturated the isekai genre is nowadays, there seems to be an isekai for every niche. Want to read about how a guy got reincarnated as a sentient sword and is wielded by a cute cat girl? There’s an isekai of that (Tensei Shitara Ken Deshita). Want to read about a guy got reincarnated as a vending machine and now travels with a cute girl? There’s an isekai of that (Jidouhanbaiki ni Umarekawatta Ore wa Meikyuu ni Samayou). Want to read about how a guy got reincarnated as a slime, makes friends with an ancient, powerful dragon and leads a village of goblins to creating a global superpower? There’s an isekai of that (Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken). Naturally, having so many isekai stories out there means that a whole lot of them are garbage and very few are good (and tasteful) pieces of literature.</p>\n<p>There are certain memes surrounding the isekai genre in popular culture. The aforementioned meme of “truck-kun” is perhaps the most prominent, caused by the trope of having your isekai protagonist reincarnate as a result of being run over by a truck - either because the driver was drunk or asleep at the wheel and unwittingly ran the unlucky (or lucky?) protagonist over or because our intrepid, heroic protagonist pushed some baby/child/teenage girl/ old lady out of the way of a truck whose driver was drunk or asleep at the wheel (wow, misandry much?). Another meme is the absurdly long title, prominent in mostly Japanese isekais (though not limited to just isekais, it seems to be a phenomenon affecting all genres), and acts more like a blurb than the title of a book. The most damning is perhaps the meme that all isekais are self-insert power fantasies of the author, characterised by an overpowered (male) protagonist with as much personality as soggy cardboard who inadvertently gains a harem of beautiful women in another world. This brings up a problem with the isekai genre in the modern age, an age where anyone with access to the internet realise their wildest fantasies onto the digital page and subject such horrors to any hapless netizen. The problem with isekai is also isekai’s greatest appeal and has been established previously in this article. It is the problem of the author being able to write whatever they want with a character that is innately somewhat relatable (after all, the character that is transported is our only link to the world we are familiar with so we feel a kinship with the character as the only remotely relatable thing in this new world). This leads to the trash of the isekai genre: the drivel perpetuated by incels, designed only to act as a way to hide their insecurities behind the generic face of the embodiment of their power fantasies. Let this not, however, distract from the truly wonderful stories that the isekai genre has to offer, who shine even brighter when compared to the relative trash littered across the internet.</p>\n<p>Similar to the grand nonnarrative proposed by Azuma, narrative consumption, as proposed by Ôtsuka Eiji, describes the act of reading smaller narratives not only for direct personal enjoyment but also as a way to access a larger, grand narrative. This grand narrative is the framework for smaller stories and is only accessed by the consumption of smaller narratives, hence narrative consumption.5 As I perceive it, the truly immersive, well-written isekais are ones that offer smaller narratives as a way to access the larger plot whilst also keeping to (or cleverly subverting) the characteristics and tropes of the grand nonnarrative. The blend of both allows the author to fully explore the world they have created without having all the exposition and lore dumped onto the main protagonist which slows down the plot. Having multiple narratives and viewpoints resolves that problem and furthermore, it develops the side characters alongside the main character as you get their thoughts and opinions on the various events of the story - it can also be used to progress the plot from another point of view or an interesting angle. That being said, isekais are written to revolve around the transported character and as such, they must be the focus of attention in most of the story otherwise the story may as well be a fantasy story without the added element of the transported character. The use of multiple narrative perspectives just allows deeper development of the world and the characters that inhabit the world rather than the reader only getting the narrative perspective of the main character, which limits the amount and also what sort of exposition or lore they can be exposed to. There are several great examples of this and each of them is a powerhouse in the isekai genre however, my favourite example is “So What If I’m a Spider, So What” (“Kumo Desu Ga, Nani Ka?”).</p>\n<p><strong>[MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD]</strong> This story subverts a lot of the common tropes of the isekai genre: the protagonist is killed in a mysterious explosion alongside her classmates and is reincarnated as a spider monster without any cheat abilities in a perilous situation (the bottom of a dangerous labyrinth, which actually adds stakes and tension to the story), thus subverting the tropes of being reincarnated as a human or humanoid and receiving some “cheat ability” to boost them ahead of their peers. Through various sidestories you are drip fed the events of the outside world through the perspective of her other classmates (also reincarnated but more in line with what is expected of an isekai) which succeeds in developing the plot and world of the story as a major motivation for one of the characters is to reunite the class which involves finding our protagonist who’s stuck in the most dangerous place on that world. Through the side characters the author, Okina Baba, also subverts the hero trope of isekais (where a transported character is the chosen hero who will save the world) by having the hero be an existence that is actively harmful to the survival of the world and ALSO offers an interesting spin on the perception of time in the story. By having the side character chapters appear so early in the novel, you, the reader, are let to believe that the events of both the side character and protagonist narratives are happening in tandem; however, it becomes subtly evident that they are not - the main events of the story (from the protagonist’s perspective) are happening a full decade before the events of the side character stories and acts as a satisfying payoff to the small details strewn about the earlier chapters that lead up to this revelation. It successfully blends both the grand narrative and the grand nonnarrative to achieve a story that clearly revolves around the core cast of transported characters whilst using the smaller narratives to fully establish all the key character motivations, backgrounds and lore of the world as well as drawing from the pool of isekai tropes to deliver a fresh take on the isekai genre and a unique story.</p>\n<p>The isekai genre is expansive and limitless in the stories it can tell. The worlds that are introduced can create such a feeling of wonder and desire to know more that it can suck you in, much like the protagonists of the stories themselves. It’s easy to get lost in the sea of isekais, in the characters and in the plot - something that the authors themselves seem to be victim to. After all, how many isekais have completed stories? It doesn’t seem like a lot of them do: 383 of the over 2100 web, light and published novels on novel updates are listed as completed and that’s just the translations of the original texts. Whilst isekai is mostly lighthearted genre consumed for mere pleasure, a bit of light reading to do when you’re bored, it is also a lesson in the dangers of burn out and capitalism. The isekai series “Overlord” (“Ōbārōdo”) has been discontinued due to the author, Kugane Maruyama, feeling burnt out after having written the series since 2012: a series that has seen 16 light novel volumes, 17 manga volumes and 4 anime seasons. Many a web novel isekai once given a manga series or anime or official publication as a light novel seems to be less interested in the overall story, the grand narrative, and more on making money. My beloved “Kumo Desu Ga, Nani Ka?” is a victim of this - the ending of the web novel was suspended whilst the author wrote the light novel (the official publication of the story) and whilst the anime was in production. When the ending was finally delivered, it was lacklustre to say the least. So whilst Dr Paul Price’s comment that these stories “have no higher meaning other than they are created with the elements and characteristics that come from the grand nonnarrative” can be held as true for the plot, perhaps they hold meaning as cautionary tales against burning out doing something you find passionate or forgoing good storytelling to make more money.</p>\n<div id=\"bibliography\">\r\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isekai\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isekai</a>  Accessed 19/08/2022</li>\n<li>Price, Paul. “A Survey of the Story Elements of Isekai Manga”.

Therefore, when I say, 'the science has told us not to eat McDonald's', what I mean is that 'multiple concordant studies in recent times have concluded that eating McDonald's out of moderation will result in long-term weight gain' [2].</p>\n<p>While that makes sense, it does include a quick sleight of hand on my part which is worth exploring. In the second statement, I assumed that the implicit objective of the first was to maintain good health. The phrase 'Should I eat McDonald's?' by itself has no aim contained within it, so technically speaking, we can't answer.</p>\n<p>While it holds colloquially, even if I had asked, 'Should I eat McDonald's to avoid gaining weight?', it's still difficult to reply in a yes or no fashion. A rigorous answer would take into account genetic factors; the other parts of your diet and lifestyle, specifically how much McDonald's; and so on to ultimately determine whether you would gain weight.</p>\n<p>Therefore, every time we use the word 'should', it's necessary that we supply an objective – i.e., a larger aim within which the action I 'should' or 'shouldn't' take lies – and that we supply the necessary context that would apply to the question.</p>\n<p>It's necessary to clarify that by saying '...how should we live?', I'm assuming that 'live' can be broken down into a series of more specific verbs. It's more productive to consider ‘how should we live?’ to mean how we should act in a finite and limited situation – and then assume that 'life' as a whole refers to a series of overlapping finite situations – rather than by trying to wrestle with fundamentally how we should live our entire lives start to finish in one go. We might end up there but it's not a useful place to start.</p>\n<p>It's also important to clarify why I'm able to use the phrase 'the science' so easily, and why I intend to for the rest of the essay. As mentioned, I'm interpreting 'science' to be a method that ensures objectivity and lack of error. Therefore, 'science', in any capacity, can refer to both the existing research of our time – i.e., currently published work on the health effects of McDonald's – as well as the hypothetical research we haven't taken yet – i.e., the implications of McDonald's that we're yet to discover. After all, both of which still fall under the domain of science, given that the correct method is used. Therefore, it's possible to say a phrase like, 'although science can't tell us how we should act right now, if we had the right technology and method, then it could'. And given that 'science' in this case refers simply to a universal method – to quote Carl Sagan [7], \"Science is more than a body of knowledge. It's a way of thinking, a way of sceptically interrogating the universe with a fine understanding of human fallibility,\" – we should be able to consider both existing science (research we have already taken) and potential science (research we either haven't done but could or research we will only have the means to do in the future) with equal merit.</p>\n<p>Back to McDonald's.</p>\n<p>Following our example, if I asked if eating a McDonald's takeaway (of specified caloric value and chemical makeup), providing the context of my diet and genetics and so on, would make me put on weight in the form of stored fat, it's reasonable to say that it's within the reach of science to answer that question. We either already have, or could obtain, the data to answer conclusively, yes or no. And we can reframe 'if I eat at McDonald's, I will gain weight' to fit into the context of the question by adding the modal verb 'should', as we discussed before. Therefore: 'If I want to maintain my weight, I should not eat at McDonald's'.</p>\n<p>As demonstrated, 'science' has told me how I should act in that situation. As such, when I supply an objective and obtain enough data, then yes, science can tell me how to live.</p>\n<h2>Part 2</h2>\n<p>You might argue that such a statement can't be concluded from a single handpicked example. And you're right. I specifically chose an example which involved an easily quantifiable value – whether the numerical value of fat in my body would increase after regular McDonald's consumption, or whether my daily processes would be sufficient to burn those calories off after each meal. When the aims and objectives we have – to pass a test with a certain score, to achieve an income above a certain value – the metric for success is black and white. It's in these cases that science can tell us how we should live with total certainty.</p>\n<p>This includes cases that aren't so obviously numerical. If my objective is for a ball in my hand to bounce, I can quantify this as whether the height of the ball post-bounce is of similar height to pre-bounce, at which point we can conclude that the ball 'bounced' (success). Any height lower than that, we can define as the ball having 'dropped' (failure). In this way, most isolated examples can be quantified, and by extension, used in a scientific context.</p>\n<p>Let's try, 'What should my favourite colour be?'. You might instinctively consider this to be a subjective and personal question, but I would argue that it too can be quantified. Current research suggests that the human eye perceives around a million different colours (since we have 3 types of cone cells each perceiving 100 shades) [3]. Let's give each colour a score from -100 to +100 based on how strongly my brain reacts to seeing that colour. For this, we can use a machine that detects levels of electrical activity in the brain.</p>\n<p>Since there are a finite number of colours, it's reasonable to assume that there will be a single colour, i.e. aquamarine, that reaches something like +99.82, beating out bright orange at +99.81, making it objectively my favourite colour. (There will be colours lower down with identical values, like a bell curve).</p>\n<p>There are two ways to interpret this information. It's true that, with a microscopic enough scale and the supremely rigorous scientific method, every example can be made into a quantifiable measure of success or failure. With the example of colour, a common objection is that there are an infinite number of colours, and so there should be a smaller subset of infinite colours all scoring +100, at which point science can't give me a single highest scoring colour; the scientific method has fallen short. But this objection fails because the human eye can only perceive a finite number of shades. The fact that our experiences are limited by our body means that at some point, all data is discrete data with a high enough resolution.</p>\n<p>But the second conclusion that I draw is more cautious. It reiterates that the assumption I took in the beginning that 'science' refers to both existing and hypothetical data is simply an assumption. While it's interesting to think that, at some level, science really could tell us how we should act in every isolated situation, the question asks 'Can science…?', not 'Will…?' or 'Could science…?'. As with every generation, our science of today is limited, so when we disregard the potential of the scientific method, there are cases where contemporary science just can't tell us how we should live. Moreover, just like how we used to believe that the universe was geocentric [4] or that cigarettes were beneficial to our health [5], there are cases today where we as a scientific community are wrong and don't know it yet. To me, this produces a more thought-provoking conclusion: for many of us, science does indeed inform the way we live, even when it is wrong.</p>\n<h2>Part 3</h2>\n<p>Things have been looking pretty favourable for science so far – it appears that in short, the answer to our question is simply 'yes; see terms and conditions'. And that's been true so far. And yet, hopefully, by the end of the essay, you'll begin to see the answer as a spectrum of many answers.</p>\n<p>Firstly, some clarity is required on what an 'isolated example' really is. I've used the term now and then to break down how we should 'live' into how we should 'act in this situation'. As I said, it's easier to grapple with. Specifically, I use it to refer to all of the actions that are taken to achieve a single objective. When my single objective was to ascertain my favourite colour, I undertook a series of actions, all of which I consider to be part of one isolated example.</p>\n<p>The difficulty comes when trying to ground these situations back into reality; going back from individual examples to 'living' as a whole. The difference is that when I have a singular objective in mind, there are a finite number of ways to achieve it, of which there is a single 'best' way to do so, i.e. most efficient and effective. I briefly mentioned an example of achieving above a certain score on a test. Either through existing scientific evidence [6] or by conducting new experiments and evaluating the data, we can determine the single most effective set of actions to take to achieve a particular score. Simultaneously, if I have responsibilities as a single parent to keep my child emotionally and physically healthy, given the nature of her genetics and lifestyle, and so on, there are a finite number of 'best' ways to achieve that, too.</p>\n<p>But what happens when I try to achieve them at the same time? Within the space of a day, let alone a year or a lifetime, each of us has hundreds of major to minute priorities that overlap simply by coexisting in my life at the same time. And the more objectives I have, the more potential outcomes there are that day for how things eventually turn out. Since I can't complete every objective to the same degree, the varying degrees of moderation to which I can achieve each task gives rise to an infinite number of possible outcomes, of which some are better than others. However, just like how increasing the number of colours I could choose from means that there will eventually be multiple colours that are equally scoring, there will necessarily be multiple 'best case' outcomes that just happen to prioritise different objectives over others.</p>\n<p>See, to say I should do something (to achieve an objective) implies that there is a single best way to go about it. If there are many equally viable actions I could take, there is no scientific imperative to choose one of them over the other, and as such, no single action I 'should' take. As such, the more equally viable actions that arise, the lesser the role of science is in determining which I should choose.</p>\n<p>This is why I think that our answer should be a spectrum rather than a clear yes or no answer. The fewer objectives we have at once, the greater the likelihood that there is one single best compromise that most effectively utilises our resources in achieving as many objectives to the greatest degree. However, as we juggle more and more objectives, the likelihood that there's more than one 'optimum' course of action determined by a scientific method increases. Simply put, the more colours we have to choose from, the greater the chance that ten, twelve or a thousand of them will all score 99.99. And out of that group, there's just no scientific method to choose the best colour; the utility of science decreases as the number of objectives you have increases.</p>\n<p>After all, to quote The Cincinnati Enquirer, 'The saying 'Life is just one damn thing after another,' is a gross understatement. The damn things overlap.'. Unfortunately, the more damn things you have, the less that science can help.</p>\n<div id=\"bibliography\">\r\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Dictionary.cambridge.org. 2022. science.

Why is this? Well, the mean of an odd number and an even number is not an integer, so it does not need to be considered. This neatly splits the sequence into two parts. In fact, given a sequence, we can multiply all the terms by 2 to get a sequence of even numbers, and take away 1 from each term in that sequence to get a sequence of odd numbers which both maintain our desired property. Finally, we can simply connect those two sequences to get a valid sequence with twice the length of the original.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 388px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/afec9355559147f538dfb5669161dab7/96c67/diamond.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 88.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Diagram 1\"\n        title=\"Diagram 1\"\n        src=\"/static/afec9355559147f538dfb5669161dab7/96c67/diamond.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/afec9355559147f538dfb5669161dab7/772e8/diamond.png 200w,\n/static/afec9355559147f538dfb5669161dab7/96c67/diamond.png 388w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>So, if we take the trivial sequence for <span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">n = 1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">n</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">=</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">1</span></span></span></span></span> (which is just the number 1), we can use this process to construct a sequence with length 2, then a sequence with length 4, length 8, etc. But how do we fill in the gaps between these powers of 2? Well, removing a number from a sequence is certainly not going to render it invalid.

beyond the scope of this article, I will mention them briefly along with a few common applications of each. One thing that surprised me in the process of writing this article was the volume of theorems in advanced set theory and group theory that used induction, relative to those in more accessible areas. Therefore, I will attempt to give a glimpse of some notable results and leave further research to those who are particularly interested.</p>\n<h3>Structural Induction</h3>\n<p>Structural induction is a technique common in graph theory and computer science concerning recursively defined structures such as formulas or tree graphs.

The process is the same except that an extra step needs to be performed to jump forward to each limit ordinal, which is an ordinal number that cannot be reached by incrementing from smaller ordinal numbers.</p>\n<p>One surprising example of transfinite induction is its use in proving Goodstein's theorem, which is a theorem about recursive sequences called Goodstein sequences. First, start with any natural number as the first term. Then, write the number as a sum of powers of 2, and write each exponent as a sum of powers of 2, etc. (for example, <span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mn>19</mn><mo>=</mo><msup><mn>2</mn><msup><mn>2</mn><mn>2</mn></msup></msup><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">19=2^{2^{2}} + 2 + 1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">19</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">=</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1.0702em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord\">2</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.9869em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">2</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.8913em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.931em;margin-right:0.0714em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.5em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size3 size1 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span><span class=\"mbin\">+</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.7278em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">2</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span><span class=\"mbin\">+</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">1</span></span></span></span></span>). This is called the hereditary base 2 representation. Then, replace each 2 in the expression with a 3, and subtract 1. This is the second term of the sequence.

The statement of the theorem is that every Goodstein sequence must eventually reach 0.</p>\n<p>The proof of Goodstein's theorem roughly entails showing that it is possible to construct a sequence of ordinal numbers parallel to the Goodstein sequence which is strictly decreasing and terminates. Therefore, the Goodstein sequence must also terminate at 0. This result is historically significant since it is one of the first true statements to be shown to be unprovable in a system of logic called Peano arithmetic, as was proved by the mathematicians Laurie Kirby and Jeff Paris in 1982.</p>\n<h3>Fermat's Last Theorem</h3>\n<p>The details of Andrew Wiles' famous proof of Fermat's Last theorem are of course inaccessible to the common person, but I feel it would be remiss to not mention it briefly. Fermat's Last Theorem is named so because it was the last theorem left unproved by the great Pierre de Fermat for hundreds of years after his death. There is a well-known story that Fermat wrote the theorem in a margin of his textbook, along with the words \"I have a marvellous proof of this theorem, which this margin is too small to contain.\" Nowadays, mathematicians doubt whether he did indeed find a valid proof with the mathematical tools available to him at the time. In any case, the theorem reads:</p>\n<div class=\"centre\">\n<p><em>For any integer <span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math

Then, he proved a special case of the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, otherwise known as the modularity theorem, which establishes a link between those elliptic curves and certain types of analytic functions called modular forms. Using this link, he showed that the elliptic curve resulting from Fermat's Last theorem failed to satisfy certain properties when turned into a modular form, therefore showing that the original equation has no solutions. As it happens, induction is used multiple times in intermediate steps of the proof, giving it the status of perhaps the most important applications of induction in recent years.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 649px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/99321a6d2c5f870c3895ad4b2f66aa5e/18f6b/wiles.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 61.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Wiles\"\n        title=\"Wiles\"\n        src=\"/static/99321a6d2c5f870c3895ad4b2f66aa5e/18f6b/wiles.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/99321a6d2c5f870c3895ad4b2f66aa5e/e07e9/wiles.jpg 200w,\n/static/99321a6d2c5f870c3895ad4b2f66aa5e/066f9/wiles.jpg 400w,\n/static/99321a6d2c5f870c3895ad4b2f66aa5e/18f6b/wiles.jpg 649w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Mathematical induction is a unique method of proof in mathematics with highly varied applications requiring insight and precise reasoning.

Notes</h2>\n<p>Not really a revolutionary idea, but last year was a great reminder that the first step to playing at an elite level is to play all the correct notes whilst making little to no mistakes. No omission of the correct note or no inclusion of a wrong note will make a high scoring performance.</p>\n<p>Obviously in other musical contexts, a wrong note can be worked around. To quote Miles Davis: “When you hit a wrong note, it’s the next note that makes it good or bad”.</p>\n<p>However, in the context of 21st century piano competitions, to play a wrong note is to sin. It is the quickest way to notify the jurors that more time could have been spent working on the musical skeleton of the piece. Familiarising yourself with the pitches of the music is the highest priority before adding your own interpretational ideas to the piece.</p>\n<p>Obviously, fruity things happen on stage: perhaps you can feel a member of the jury really laying down judgement on you for your hair; maybe your mum is in the crowd somewhere; maybe you just don’t have a lot of experience. Whatever the reason, we can get nervous and make mistakes as a result. That’s just one of those things that happens. Even at the highest level, those performers are still human; depending on the musical context and degree of error, the mistake may go unnoticed. When you make a mistake in a performance setting: the best response is to ignore it and recover the piece.</p>\n<p>However, in a practice setting we should really be aiming for as perfect as possible. When you make a mistake during practice: the best response is to go back and correct it such that you minimise the chance of making the same mistake again. This also ensures that we learn the music as written - reducing our chance of producing errors on stage.</p>\n<p>Practice slowly and diligently. Our art form is a discipline, first and foremost. To quote a certain concert pianist when asked why he never played wrong notes, “I don’t practice them”. The need for self control cannot be understated here, so going slow and steady with a metronome is ideal. If you are recapitulating lines of music without any attention to exactly what you hear, that’s not really practising - that’s playing.</p>\n<p>Our goal when practising should be to play through something without making mistakes - this means we cannot approximate or guess anything: not the time, not the melody, not the fingering. Every detail should be deliberate and controlled.</p>\n<p>The amount of music you end up playing doesn’t matter. During practice, the only metric you should be counting is the number of mistakes you make. Graham Fitch emphasises the quality of practice being important: suggesting a routine of smaller, focussed practice sessions of 20-30 minutes each. The bottom line is if you cannot play a piece through slowly with no mistakes, you cannot assume that you can do so at tempo, whilst adding artistic flair and interpretation in a performance setting.</p>\n<h2>2 - Clarity as a Tool</h2>\n<p>Upon watching Bruce Liu’s final round performance, the first thing someone might notice is how blazingly fast Liu can play. It becomes really obvious that this guy goes at whatever speed he wants because of his technical capacity. While his competitors might be surviving through certain passages, Liu exercises his talent-founded prerogative to play them however he likes. It’s really easy to forget or outright dismiss other merits of Liu’s playing given his captivating dexterity.</p>\n<div class=\"image-card-left\">\n    <div class=\"image\"><div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 425px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/93a7b78c1037e5fe532ef21cc5629dca/2fbbf/Liu.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 72%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Bruce Liu’s final round performance\" title=\"Bruce Liu’s final round performance\" src=\"/static/93a7b78c1037e5fe532ef21cc5629dca/2fbbf/Liu.png\" srcset=\"/static/93a7b78c1037e5fe532ef21cc5629dca/772e8/Liu.png 200w,\n/static/93a7b78c1037e5fe532ef21cc5629dca/e17e5/Liu.png 400w,\n/static/93a7b78c1037e5fe532ef21cc5629dca/2fbbf/Liu.png 425w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div></div>\n    <p>Complementing Liu’s demonic speed and fluidity is his crystalline clarity. We might talk about a melody being particularly embellished with cascading runs and exciting turns but Liu really does play the ornaments - there are no real embellishments. The “embellishments” are considered part of the melody.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Clarity is the result of a strong technical foundation combined with true legato. Because of that, it allows us to communicate that we are technically fluent and mechanically able to express ourselves on our instrument - it gives your performance a virtuosic spice. More importantly, clarity helps communicate melodic ideas to our audience. Musical ideas may not form as a result of clarity, but they are often greatly aided by it; if the audience cannot clearly make out what we are playing, we cannot hope to communicate our musical ideas to them.</p>\n<p>Liu is clearly an incredibly talented individual and plays better than the majority of us could ever hope to play. In an interview for The Korea Times, Liu humbly stated that piano is just a “hobby” which he carries lots of passion for. However, is there anything that we could take away from his playing?</p>\n<p>We often are easily able to achieve the connection part of legato by allowing our notes to overlap each other. However, that makes our playing hazy and we lose clarity. One way to improve clarity from practice is to practise our melodies staccato. After a few times, we can gradually lengthen the duration of the notes we play until they are connected without overlapping. At this point we will have achieved true legato with perfect clarity.</p>\n<h2>3 - The Need for Musicality</h2>\n<div class=\"image-card-right\">\n    <p>Fans of Aimi Kobayashi may look back to her showing in 2015 and remember the agitation and fire she played with. A raw, emotionally turbulent player who dictated rubato, dynamics, and articulation to create a crude sensation.<br><br>In contrast, the Aimi Kobayashi who came out last year was much more controlled and deliberate. She still encapsulates reverie and effect extremely well, but there’s a hint of refinement in it. The kind of control that you’d only expect from someone who could perceive time slower - that’s what she showed us last year.</p>\n    <div class=\"image\"><div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 453px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/5c73bebb6566bf3d9cd3bd3e8d825968/2108e/Aimi.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 67%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Aimi Kobayashi\" title=\"Aimi Kobayashi\" src=\"/static/5c73bebb6566bf3d9cd3bd3e8d825968/2108e/Aimi.png\" srcset=\"/static/5c73bebb6566bf3d9cd3bd3e8d825968/772e8/Aimi.png 200w,\n/static/5c73bebb6566bf3d9cd3bd3e8d825968/e17e5/Aimi.png 400w,\n/static/5c73bebb6566bf3d9cd3bd3e8d825968/2108e/Aimi.png 453w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div></div>\n</div>\n<p>In her performance of the Concerto in E minor, op.11 in the final round, Kobayashi played at a much slower tempo than the accepted interpretation. She chose to throw away virtuosity in exchange for delicate, contoured playing. It’s at this slower tempo that Kobayashi shows off her ability to craft and shape melodic lines into something beyond the standard often displayed at the highest level. Kobayashi’s delicate touches dance effortlessly across the higher register and cascade melodiously downwards. Despite the slower tempo, it’s still very much Kobayashi: emotional playing directed meticulously by the individual fingers; she’s just being honest about her interpretation. It’s a brave thing to go against the grain in any context, but especially so in a well established piece at an international competition. From a competitive standpoint it falls short, Kobayashi misses out on opportunities to show off her technicality; from a musical standpoint her gambit paid dividends: although it’s not quite the technical spectacle of Bruce Liu, it’s utterly beautiful.</p>\n<p>Some identifying characteristics of Chopin’s work are the lyrical melodies which often sit upon a strong harmonic accompaniment which really carry his heightened level of emotional expression. Kobayashi takes this writing and invites herself to freely express herself musically across the piano.</p>\n<p>I think what we could all learn from her performance is how the temperament of your nature can affect your playing. Sometimes it may seem musically inappropriate, but there is a reward to allowing yourself to actually play more. Of course, it is also important to recognise when you are overplaying but that’s something that comes with time, as it did for Kobayashi.</p>\n<p>In practise we can work on our musicality by really playing to our ear’s decree. “Is what I’m playing really what I want it to sound like?” If we find ourselves struggling, we can turn to other sources for inspiration: “how does famous performer A play this part? How does famous performer B do it? Which do I prefer?”. Find out how your teacher might play that line. Questions like these can shape our interpretations immensely. Fuss over every detail to make sure your work is a true expression of self.</p>\n<h2>4 - Communication is Key</h2>\n<p>As Tiffany Poon noted in a 2020 interview with Bachtrack, classical music has a “disconnect between the audience and the music. The composers are dead and there just isn’t that human connection anymore.” She’s profoundly right.</p>\n<div class=\"image-card-left\">\n    <div class=\"image\"><div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 468px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/740fc856b30b3d667b19cce711c28682/90372/Sumino.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Hayato Sumino\" title=\"Hayato Sumino\" src=\"/static/740fc856b30b3d667b19cce711c28682/90372/Sumino.png\" srcset=\"/static/740fc856b30b3d667b19cce711c28682/772e8/Sumino.png 200w,\n/static/740fc856b30b3d667b19cce711c28682/e17e5/Sumino.png 400w,\n/static/740fc856b30b3d667b19cce711c28682/90372/Sumino.png 468w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div></div>\n    <p>Hayato Sumino might not have made it into the final round, but he definitely reached a lot of people with his communicative instinct. His first round performance has so far garnered 2.8 million views, the most of any non final round performance. </p>\n</div>\n<p>Listening to Sumino is really easy. He writes all his feelings and nuances down on a piece of paper for you to look at and read. Although Kobayashi is musically brilliant, it’s not quite as near to us as Sumino. And I feel like that’s exactly what makes him so great; Sumino has this ability to speak to us through his playing: every little articulation carries that spark of life which, in turn, gives his performances a refreshing vitality.</p>\n<p>Sometimes we have a specific narrative to convey if we are playing program music. Of course, in this scenario our job, as the musicians, is to pass on the extramusical meaning to our audience.</p>\n<p>Sometimes we are lucky enough to have a creative motive accessible to us; in this case it might be worth trying to come up with your own related narrative to communicate back to the audience.</p>\n<p>If we are very unfortunate, we might not have the background or creative motive behind a piece accessible to us either. In such cases, a safe but liberating approach is to extrapolate whatever emotions naturally come to you from the music.</p>\n<p>I think for a lot of us musicians, we don’t really struggle with conveying any given emotion on command. It’s just the ambiguity of what we are meant to do given source material which has gone through potentially hundreds of years. My interpretation cannot bring Schubert’s very will and message back.</p>\n<p>A first step towards improving your communication on your instrument is to define exactly what emotion you, the performer, are trying to convey - not the emotion that the composer wanted to convey, and certainly not whatever emotion the audience will extrapolate from you. We want to keep the creative vision in our mind transparent, not sentimentally self-indulgent, and most importantly - it should largely come from us.</p>\n<p>Once we have defined our creative vision, we should then be able to use our sonar palette to shape our interpretation into a refined product. As clichéd as it sounds, there isn’t really an incorrect answer here - but it has to be with the goal of communicating. “Does that tenuto actually help us convey an emotion or does it feel good to play?” The clearer your creative vision is, the easier this part should be.</p>\n<p>It’s important to understand that your interpretation can change.Allow yourself to change bits of it - allow your musicality to guide your creative choices, including how you choose to communicate a piece.</p>\n<h2>Closing Comments</h2>\n<p>As Adam Neely famously thrice said, \"repetition legitimises\".

Chaos can originate from the simplest things, and we will now be looking at the simplest chaotic system: the logistic map.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a fixed variable r, a variable x (that is between 0 and 1) and another variable (1-x). Now, we can form a simple sequence with x<sub>n+1</sub> = x<sub>n</sub> * (1-x<sub>n</sub>) * r. Let’s first take r = 2 and x<sub>0</sub> = 0.25, meaning 1-x<sub>0</sub> = 0.75.</p>\n<p>x<sub>1</sub> = (2)<em>(0.1)</em>(0.9) = 0.18</p>\n<p>x<sub>2</sub> = (2)<em>(0.18)</em>(1-0.18) = 0.2952</p>\n<p>Next, you’ll get values of x<sub>3</sub> = 0.41611392, x<sub>4</sub> = 0.4859262512 (10dp), x<sub>5</sub> = 0.4996038592 (10dp), x<sub>6</sub> = 0.4999996861 (10dp). As you can see, the sequence is getting ever closer to 0.5, which is called the attracting point of the system. The starting value of 0.1 has no relation to the attracting point, as with any starting number between 0 and 1 will yield the same attracting point.</p>\n<p>What’s interesting however, is what happens when we change the value of r. If we change r to 3.1, keep the starting value as 0.1, and round of our results at 2dp, the sequence will go:</p>\n<p>0.1, 0.28, 0.62, 0.73, 0.61, 0.73, 0.60, 0.74, 0.59, 0.75, 0.59, 0.75, 0.58, 0.76, 0.57, 0.76, 0.57, 0.76, 0.56, 0.76, 0.56, 0.76, 0.56, 0.76, 0.56.</p>\n<p>This time, the sequence doesn’t tend to 1 value but rather fluctuates between 2, namely 0.76 and 0.56. This is called an attracting 2-cycle.</p>\n<p>When r = 3.5, we get an attracting 4-cycle between 0.50, 0.87, 0.38 and 0.83.</p>\n<p>We can figure out new values of r where we find attracting 8-cycles or 16-cycles, etc. This is called a sequence of bifurcations. Once r exceeds approximately 3.56995, something new happens. Taking r = 3.57 will give us the sequence 0.1, 0.32, 0.78, 0.62, 0.84, 0.47, 0.89, 0.35, 0.81, 0.54, 0.89, 0.36, etc.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to think that if you let the sequence run on for long enough, eventually, a pattern will emerge, but it will in fact not. This is the core of mathematical chaos. No matter how long the program runs for, the sequence just jumps around seemingly randomly. Furthermore, even if we change the starting value by microscopic amounts, the new sequence will look completely different to the original.</p>\n<h2>Chaos in real life</h2>\n<p>The (arguable) founder of chaos theory is Edward Norton Lorenz, a mathematician and meteorologist, who, in 1961, used a simple digital computer to simulate weather patterns. This simulation was modelled by 12 variables, such as temperature and wind speed. He wanted to see a certain sequence of data again so, to save time, he started the simulation in the middle of its course by entering a printout of data that corresponded to conditions in the middle of the original simulation. What was surprising was that the predictions made by the machine were completely different from the previous calculation. The reason for this was due to the printout containing rounded values. The computer itself worked with a 6-digit precision (0.991231), while the printed values contained 3-digit values (0.991). The difference is minuscule and the consensus at the time was that there should be no difference practically. Lorenz has just discovered that small changes in initial conditions produce large changes in long-term outcome.</p>\n<p>This means that as the resolution of weather readings increases, the predictions of future weather will change drastically. In 1969, Lorenz described the butterfly effect which entails that even the tiniest factor has a significant impact on an outcome, such as a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil being the cause of a tornado a few weeks later in Texas.</p>\n<p>Let’s take another field now, such as astronomy. In space, bodies, such as planets and stars, orbit around each other under the mutual attraction of gravity.</p>\n<p>When there are just 2 bodies, their paths of orbit are extremely simple to calculate. Planets orbit stars in ellipses. Stars can be locked in orbit around each other. When two bodies move towards one another, if they travel slowly they will spiral inwards slowly until they collide or orbit each other indefinitely, and if they travel quickly they will fly along predictable parabolas or hyperbolas away from each other.</p>\n<p>When there are 3 bodies interacting with each other however, the situation becomes very chaotic. The paths that the 3 bodies take are highly complex and are unique, so will never repeat unlike the clear ellipses or parabolas when 2 bodies pass by each other. The slightest change (e.g. one of the bodies arrives one millisecond later) will drastically change the outcome. For example, rather than performing a series of rotations around each other before flying off, they could now all collide together.</p>\n<p>This is called the 3-body problem, and was the first discovered example of chaos in physics.</p>\n<h2>What is chaos theory?</h2>\n<p>Chaos theory is the branch of mathematics which focuses on finding underlying patterns and laws of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to their starting conditions, that had previously been thought of as completely random, in states of disorder and with irregularities.</p>\n<p>Chaos theory states that within the apparent randomness of chaotic complex systems, there are underlying patterns, interconnections, constant feedback loops, repetition, self-similarity, fractals, and self-organisation. These are the key principles of chaos theory.</p>\n<p>The chaotic systems, like the logistic map which we discussed earlier, are predictable for a while and then ‘appear’ to be random. The amount of time for which a chaotic system can be predicted depends on 3 factors: how much uncertainty can be tolerated; how accurately its current state can be measured; and a time scale which depends on the dynamics of the system (called the Lyapunov time).</p>\n<p>In chaotic systems, the prediction inaccuracy increases exponentially with time passed - for example, doubling the length of time passed in a forecast will result in an uncertainty which is more than squared. This means that an accurate prediction cannot be made for events too far in the future (after an interval of more than two or three times the Lyapunov time), which is when the system appears to become random.</p>\n<p>A commonly used definition, made by Robert L. Devaney, says that to be classified as chaotic, a dynamic system must have three properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It must be sensitive to initial conditions, which again relates back to the butterfly effect (a small change in one state of a system can result in large differences in a later state).</li>\n<li>It must be topologically transitive, which roughly means that neighbourhoods of points eventually get flung out to “big” sets so that they don’t necessarily stick together in one localised clump.</li>\n<li>It must have dense periodic orbits, which means that there must be attracting points in the system, which we have briefly talked about earlier.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For any interested, I highly recommend you go fuel your interest further online as I have only briefly covered the main aspects of chaos theory in this article. Thank you all for reading, I hope you enjoyed this article and can now tell people the difference between normal chaos and mathematical chaos.</p>\n<div id=\"bibliography\">\r\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Elwes, R 2011, 2012, How to solve the da vinci code and 34 other really interesting uses of mathematics, Quercus, London.</li>\n<li>Fractal Foundation (no date) What is chaos theory?.

I wish not to insult, judge, marginalise or criticise the one uniqueness we all have in this current period of time. In fact, it is the total opposite. I aim to open your eyes to the psychology and sociology behind music. The way that tiny vibrations in air impact our lives can seem like a web too complex to unravel, with connections in all areas. Religion, culture, media, sport; the list is endless. But with so much variation in genres and experiences, nobody is safe from the criticism of The Masses. This article will explore our relationship with music, why we like what we do, why society says its wrong and how, no matter how hard we try, we cannot change our musical taste.</p>\n<h2>The development of Musical You</h2>\n<p>Like all tastes, musical preference comes from a plethora of sources. It could be that you discovered disco from a diner in Dublin or revelled in rock in Reading. Our experiences can be as small as a snippet or as long as “Echoes” by Pink Floyd. A musical idea implants itself from the very second it enters our brain, which makes our younger years a melting pot of sound. Our control over what we hear is very limited at a young age, but when we grow older, we gain records, CD’s, and Spotify to satiate our discographic desires. Therefore, our initial uncontrolled impressions can develop and grow as we gain the ability to listen to what we please. However, it is argued to an extent that our likes are partly predefined, linked to our very personality.</p>\n<p>It has long been speculated by the intelligentsia that listening to Jazz was only for minds that understood it, hence the stereotype that with academic prowess comes a love of Coltrane. In a study by the University of Texas, they sought out to break down whether personality types affected our musical taste. Using categories of reflective and complex (jazz, classical and folk), upbeat and conventional (country and pop), intense and rebellious (rock, alt and punk) and energetic and rhythmic (hip-hop, soul and funk), they found striking similarities between taste and personality down to details as small as political ideology. For example, if a participant listened to “intense and rebellious” music, a correlation shows they are supportive of the opposition political party to the one in power. Furthermore, those who listen to pop are extroverted and agreeable, but socially and emotionally unstable and those with liberal social ideas do in fact prefer Jazz. Therefore, your music taste is in part out of your hands entirely, with a significant portion being down to your personality.</p>\n<p>If you are female between 11 and 14, or male between 13 and 16, go listen to more music now! Seriously, stop reading and go diversify your taste! According to evidence by Stan Stephens-Davidowitz’s study for the New York Times, these are your crucial ages for the creation of your preferences. In studying every Billboard chart-topping track from 1960-2000 and matching it with Spotify data , the favourites of different ages become apparent. The classic teenage tropes of becoming independent and forging your own path are just as applicable to music. Consider the song Creep by Radiohead for example (I can already hear the complaints flying in). The song sits as the 164th most popular song amongst men who are currently 43 years old, but if we look at men 10 years older and younger, the song doesn’t even clock in the top 300. Here it is important to note that the song was released in 1993, when our Radiohead fans were 14 years old, directly in the middle of our age range for men. It is not just isolated to alt indie 90’s rock either and this can be seen in simply talking to your parents about their music taste. The crucial aspect is not entirely when the song was released, rather when you are first introduced to that genre or artist. Just because your Mum’s favourite song is Hound Dog, doesn’t mean she is necessarily 75 years old , just that Elvis came into her musical radar in the above time period. However, the societal pressure of listening to that new album is what drives the previous, and most other examples. Now don’t panic too much, there is still something you can do if you so wish to swap Swift for Slipknot. The study concluded that exposure in our early 20’s is approximately half as influential than that in our teens, with the effect trailing off as one gets older. This continues on until we die, with very small adjustments being made the older we become.</p>\n<p>By 33 years old, studies show that people stop seeking out new genres of music and slowly gravitate back to the tunes of their teenage years, seeking the youthful vagrancy, joy and excitement they experienced and therefore associate with the music. When pensioners are studied, this age they seek out is slightly later, in their early 20’s, when their life starts to stabilise and become more carefree. In short, once we pass our crucial years of development, we use our previous music taste to try and return to those years we so dearly miss, instead of broadening our taste to experience something new.</p>\n<h2>Lies, lies and more lies</h2>\n<p>Our music taste is one of the things that comes up time and time again in conversational small talk, whether it be with a friend, colleague, boss, or stranger. It gives us an opportunity to express our likes and dislikes in a supposedly non-judgemental space where we are free to fight The Who against the Supremes. Due to this reflection that certain musical genres are associated with favourable personality types (and this is true to some extent), many people take it to the extreme. An international survey of 8000 adults exposed that 42% of adults will lie about the songs and artists they have listened to in order to seem more sophisticated or rebellious in what is essentially a futile scenario. We also give the excuse of “not wanting to hurt someone’s feelings” when saying we have listened to an artist we have not, with 40% citing this as the reason. This deceit continues into relationships, where 20% of those who lied stating it was to impress a potential partner on a first date.\r\nBut is lying really all that bad? Over two thirds of those who stated they had lied, then went on to listen to that song and this will inevitably open up a new possibility for one to affirm their taste, or perhaps discover something they never knew they had liked. This is the beauty of music. Due to our near constant exposure to new sounds, we can have a “musical gap” in our minds which can be filled later in life. One who listens to Jazz and Funk as a teenager will almost certainly enjoy Jamiroquai as an adult even if not experienced before. This is due to how interconnected styles can be and how the enjoyment of certain features are subconsciously stores as a part of your musical taste, awaiting discovery later in life.</p>\n<h2>But my taste is better!</h2>\n<p>Every one of us has met that person who is just better than you because of their taste in music and if you haven’t, well chances are you are that person. Regardless of your\r\nclass, social standing, income, or appearance, some simply consider themselves superior because their little air waves in a specific order are better.</p>\n<p>This is the biggest fallacy you will ever be told.</p>\n<p>There is no objective way to qualify music as good or bad other than the number of people to enjoy it. I for one am not a fan of Cubano Pop due to my experiences, cultural upbringing, and exposure. But if I were to claim it was terrible, I would not be thinking rationally at all. There are millions of fans, and it is as futile as trying to say if a food is good or not. In fact, it is even more futile. Whilst many rightly argue that “without music, what are we?”, without food, we are dead. Therefore, if we cannot agree on which foods are the best to keep us alive due to biological necessity and which are the most enjoyable, how can we even begin to comprehend which music “is best for our survival and culture”? Alas, musical purists continue to perpetuate stereotypes to justify their stance. So called “Tasteless” artists like Taylor Swift 1D or Billie Eilish are mainly enjoyed by teenage girls which means it is instantly devoid of value according to society. This ridiculing leaves people feeling isolated from what they enjoy, lest they upset the musical Big Brother, and it can ruin the experience of musical at the most critical time in somebodies’ life.</p>\n<p>The reason behind this obtuseness is simply the passage of time. As time goes on, we remember almost all of the absolute classics, the chart toppers and the “bangers” and a couple of “tragic” songs mocked by the majority. Even these tragedies become popular as the reputation spreads and people listen to it more. Nowadays, the “bad” coexists with the “good” and in 20 years’ time the cycle will repeat itself, but for now we the individuals are stuck with the criticism of the Musical Elite and sometimes the general public as well. Therefore, since your musical ideals will always be held as “bad” for so many, criticism is inescapable, but the joy lies in realising the depth of musical taste, its links to our personality and how it develops in the first place.</p>\n<p>Then to summarise, whilst your musical taste will never be identical to anyone else’s, sparking criticism, and it is almost entirely set in stone, we all still relish and savour music. So, ignore the criticism, broaden your taste whilst you still somewhat can and reengage with your musical humanity. Don’t lie about your taste too, but if you do, make good out of it. In attempting to understand and engage with what others find so dear, we better our musical and in fact our entire selves. In essence “All I’m asking, is for a little respect.”</p>\n<div id=\"bibliography\">\r\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>COO, C., 2022.

The rapid pace at which technology is evolving is bringing forth the possibility of daily space travel, which earlier seemed to be a distant fantasy. This rate of development, with the aid of continuous innovation from private firms within the industry, raises the question of how long will we have to wait before star systems become within our grasp?</p>\n<p>The viability of eventually traversing exoplanets, planets outside our solar system, relies on two main factors – our ability to detect them and proficiency in discovering the climate on these planets to test for their habitability. The second of these factors is made much easier once the first is tackled.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to detect an exoplanet would just be to observe it. However, this is much more difficult than it first seems since we are able to perceive objects due to light reflecting off them. In the case of exoplanets, regardless of whether an atmosphere is present that reflects an abundance of light, the light that is reflected by the exoplanet will be overwhelmed by the light being emitted by the host star. It is analogous to holding a candle in front of stadium lights; although the flame is there, you cannot see it as it is inundated by the luminosity of the floodlights. As a result, we must explore three other methods for detecting and classifying exoplanets: Radial velocity, transits, and gravitational microlensing.</p>\n<p>The radial velocity method is one of the simplest and relies on the interaction of gravitational fields, irrespective of the masses present. You may recall that every object with a mass is accompanied with a gravitational field and the heavier the object, the stronger the gravitational field. Therefore, a planet also has a gravitational effect on its star despite being a miniscule one. This causes a wobbling of the star and can in turn be used to detect exoplanets. Due to this wobble being more pronounced the closer a planet is and the larger the mass of the planet.</p>\n<p>This method is most easily used on millisecond pulsars which are a special type of star formed from the remnants of a supernova and very dense and very radioactive so even if there are planets here, they are never going to be habitable. What is special about millisecond pulsars is that they release exact periodic pulses of radio waves which can be measured from Earth and plotted against time. If there exists a planet in orbit around a millisecond pulsar then it causes the pulses, every so often, to be offbeat.</p>\n<p>This ‘offbeat’ pulse is regularly repeated thus giving astronomers the value of the period of the orbit the planet has around the pulsar. Using this and formula 1, you can calculate the radius of the orbit of the planet.</p>\n<div class=\"math math-display\"><span class=\"katex-display\"><span class=\"katex\"><span

the pulses will need to be over years rather than days or weeks. Secondly, if we are trying to find habitable planets then this is completely the wrong place to look as no life would survive under the harsh radioactive conditions. Thirdly, even if a planet is very close in, it produces a very small wobble so any planet further out, maybe in the goldilocks zone (a region of orbit around a star where it is possible for liquid water to exist), will not be detectable with this method as the wobble just would not be distinguishable. Fourthly, the planets found using this method are almost always hot Jupiters as they are both close in and are ‘massive’. A hot Jupiter is a Jupiter-sized planet, which could be rocky or gaseous that is very close to its host star hence it is hot. Finally, using this method we have no way to prove that what we are measuring the effects of is a planet or if it is a dwarf star in a binary system with the pulsar. To prove that it is in fact a planet we need to know both its mass and density, we have mass but to find density we must use the next method, transit.</p>\n<p>Transits are events that happen when an exoplanet passes in front of its host star relative to us. This leads to a slight dimming in the light that reaches us. Once per orbit, this dip can be measured to find the radius of the planet, <span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math

For every transit there exists a secondary transit, which happens when the planet is behind the star and a secondary dip in brightness is observed. This is due to the fact that a planet is reflective so at every point except when the planet is behind the star it is also contributing very slightly to the light that reaches us. A graph of flux (a measure of brightness) against time is shown below:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/f477234a848e0d4990686486ea6cb6b2/9937c/Secondarytransit.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 59.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Secondary transit\"\n        title=\"Secondary transit\"\n        src=\"/static/f477234a848e0d4990686486ea6cb6b2/5a190/Secondarytransit.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/f477234a848e0d4990686486ea6cb6b2/772e8/Secondarytransit.png 200w,\n/static/f477234a848e0d4990686486ea6cb6b2/e17e5/Secondarytransit.png 400w,\n/static/f477234a848e0d4990686486ea6cb6b2/5a190/Secondarytransit.png 800w,\n/static/f477234a848e0d4990686486ea6cb6b2/9937c/Secondarytransit.png 1156w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Secondary transits are very difficult to do as the change in brightness is miniscule and indistinguishable from atmospheric disturbance in telescopes on Earth. Which is why space telescopes such as Hubble and Spitzer are used, recently the James Webb was also added to the fleet.</p>\n<p>By subtracting a spectrum taken during the secondary transit from one taken just out of the secondary transit, the spectrum of the day side of the planet can be obtained and thus planets like J1719-1438 can be discovered. This planet also dubbed as the ‘diamond planet’ has around the mass of Jupiter but has the size of a core of a dwarf star, this extreme density causes massive pressures on the mostly carbon surface turning it into diamonds. Even though many planets have been discovered by Kepler, Spritzer, Hubble and many more using this method, they all have one flaw that is shared with the planets discovered using radial velocity measurements; almost all of them are hot Jupiters and if not then they are just extremely hot rocky planets. To help solve this and allow us to ‘see’ more Earth-like planets, we need to employ the phenomenon of gravitational microlensing.</p>\n<p>Gravity, although the weakest of the four fundamental forces, can bend light by bending the fabric of space-time. In this way, when we look at a very distant object such as the bulge at the centre of our galaxy, and a massive object comes in between (for the sake of this explanation let’s say it comes directly halfway in between) our line of sight, it distorts the image we perceive. This very effect is called gravitational microlensing and has been demonstrated in the example below.</p>\n<p>Diagram 1 shows a singular ray of light from the focus (the bulge at the centre of the galaxy) as it is bent around the lens star leading to an increase in brightness of the image. If we instead look at every ray rather than singular ones, we see something like image 1:</p>\n<div class=\"multi-image-row-2\">\n<div class=\"image\"><div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/f3d29b6c9225838f5294468b70c214dc/29007/Diagram1.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 58.50000000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Diagram 1\" title=\"Diagram 1\" src=\"/static/f3d29b6c9225838f5294468b70c214dc/5a190/Diagram1.png\" srcset=\"/static/f3d29b6c9225838f5294468b70c214dc/772e8/Diagram1.png 200w,\n/static/f3d29b6c9225838f5294468b70c214dc/e17e5/Diagram1.png 400w,\n/static/f3d29b6c9225838f5294468b70c214dc/5a190/Diagram1.png 800w,\n/static/f3d29b6c9225838f5294468b70c214dc/c1b63/Diagram1.png 1200w,\n/static/f3d29b6c9225838f5294468b70c214dc/29007/Diagram1.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div></div>\n<div class=\"image\"><div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/2e2153dacfe9020f0f6bc69b03fcc696/d7ab4/Image1.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 60.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAMCAYAAABiDJ37AAAACXBIWXMAAA7DAAAOwwHHb6hkAAAB/klEQVQoz01Sy24TQRBc4Z3unp5Zx14/sOy1EhwnkMSEyEgBKULkkDtI3LjwH/wAP8T/Feqetc2hJHt2uroeUzETxEACZnaIEDRGBCK0TUTXZoTAx+9EJ9g8s4DsnAWVcDlMmhCjQIRhZ2c5QYURhaEcnEhFfDn5zIHkPxCh4p4wxogmZ+SUMBslvD+fOVlSxdlZi6QRjUZfaGQFB8WHJYyKpahiIldoVpukGCaF0gBjjZg0GeOcEM0ekd+3e0QBxOU/eVRcFBqR4bDRrGUO2HRLXM/HWKca68kIV9e78i0pcjK1JiaChU8Z2gZN0WE2PEcaYLla4fnpC77tpvj1ucP9XPB2u8ViPoNQ7TFpUuw/7NCOR6gpHCzz0b9JLoQ1uuUSD90cv7/f4O+fH3jZZGwWLebTFsJ1cSOE6bRFyuovgqXPkL1N8XZLyzVmkwluzzu8bDN+fpzhcRVxu32DYZPBHPxeTYRXoe7tWgeMSlWd0CB9QWKZCuHy8gqPD3t8urvB16dnrBevIRygkd3ixWKE5aRxdSqFtLJnYT+GOTq0L8iGUmR06zXu7vdYdx1Ualch/ft8txphNk5ObmKckNw7YZgEWYvSYAF7ngwOA4RBhUgDXyKxv58jFm1226eWCZXEYvFQjA1dTMdoh6k06YrjUVmJp5A4mc8WdUb4D5pEE4u14xFNAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Image 1\" title=\"Image 1\" src=\"/static/2e2153dacfe9020f0f6bc69b03fcc696/5a190/Image1.png\" srcset=\"/static/2e2153dacfe9020f0f6bc69b03fcc696/772e8/Image1.png 200w,\n/static/2e2153dacfe9020f0f6bc69b03fcc696/e17e5/Image1.png 400w,\n/static/2e2153dacfe9020f0f6bc69b03fcc696/5a190/Image1.png 800w,\n/static/2e2153dacfe9020f0f6bc69b03fcc696/d7ab4/Image1.png 1014w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div></div>\n</div>\n<p>Since we know what the focus image behind the lens looks like ‘normally’, we are able to reverse engineer a lens shape to fit the scenario. The lens is what we are interested in as there are distinct patterns that emerge if the lens is just a lone star versus if it has a planet in its orbit. This is a very powerful, although rare, tool because we now have a way to detect the previously elusive ‘non-Hot Jupiters’ also known as Super-Earths or Mini-Neptunes which lie further out from the star. What seems to be microlensing’s Achilles heel is the fact that it is a very rare event so while it may be our ace method, it is unreliable.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, I think the idea of human beings leaving our solar system is currently absurd and will be for many hundreds of years mostly because, evident to this article, we wouldn’t know where to go. There are many theoretical models for space travel but all of them focus on the journey rather than the end point, if we cannot find perfectly habitable planets close to us then I think it is a waste of resources to experiment ways to get there. It is much more prudent for Mars and Venus to be our top priority. On the other hand, we as a species are very adept at accelerating scientific progress at the cost of our planet, so who is to say we won’t breakthrough again to find Earth 2.0.</p>\n<div id=\"bibliography\">\r\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>All graphs and equations come from the exoplanets course; <a href=\"https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:ANUx+ANU-ASTRO2x+2T2020/home\">Course | Astrophysics: Exploring Exoplanets | edX</a></li>\n<li>Diagram 1; <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/gravitational-microlensing\">gravitational microlensing | astronomy | Britannica</a></li>\n<li>Image 1; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_microlensing#/media/File:A_Horseshoe_Einstein_Ring_from_Hubble.JPG\">A Horseshoe Einstein Ring from Hubble - Gravitational microlensing - Wikipedia</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"type":"Article","first_name":null,"surname":null,"school":null,"pronouns":null,"role":null,"slug":"/articles/14","profile_picture":null,"title":"Is there hope for humanity to expand its authority onto other star systems?","composer":null,"subject":"9C2111","userID":null,"articleID":"14","userIDs":["e"],"preview_image":"SpaceConoly.jpg","issue":1}},{"html":"<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<div class=\"image-card-left\">\n    <div class=\"image\">\n        <div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/2b9c984f071812834a80c7acce75ed90/7317f/Galaxies.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 54%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Fig 1\" title=\"Fig 1\" src=\"/static/2b9c984f071812834a80c7acce75ed90/4b190/Galaxies.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/2b9c984f071812834a80c7acce75ed90/e07e9/Galaxies.jpg 200w,\n/static/2b9c984f071812834a80c7acce75ed90/066f9/Galaxies.jpg 400w,\n/static/2b9c984f071812834a80c7acce75ed90/4b190/Galaxies.jpg 800w,\n/static/2b9c984f071812834a80c7acce75ed90/e5166/Galaxies.jpg 1200w,\n/static/2b9c984f071812834a80c7acce75ed90/7317f/Galaxies.jpg 1369w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div>\n        <em>Fig. 1 Illustrations of the three main types of galaxies (top) with actual photos of galaxies (bottom) that fit the categories. [2]</em>\n    </div>\n    <p>Almost every galaxy in our universe can be categorised into three types: Spiral, elliptical, or irregular (see Fig.1). This system of classifying galaxies via their shapes was first established by Edwin Hubble [1].<br><br>Spiral galaxies are further divided into three classes based on their shapes: Ordinary spiral galaxies (consisting of a central bulge and spiral arms), barred spiral galaxies (featuring an elongated bar of stars across the central bulge), and lenticular spiral galaxies (having disc-shaped features as opposed to spiral arms) [1]. These galaxies appear to be very “dusty” and make up approximately 60% of all galaxies.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Elliptical galaxies, on the other hand, are differentiated based on a scale ranging from E0 to E5, where E0 is spherical and E5 is elongated. They are observed to have very little dust and gas compared to spiral galaxies, but appear to be older [1], making up 10-15% of all galaxies.</p>\n<p>Lastly, irregular galaxies consist of galaxies that have no regular shape or form. They are estimated to make up 25% of all galaxies, and are believed to have been more prevalent in the early universe. Additionally, these galaxies are generally smaller, and are often satellite galaxies of larger spiral or elliptical galaxies [1].</p>\n<p>However, some galaxies fall outside this classification system; approximately one in ten thousand galaxies fall into one of the rarest categories – ring galaxies.</p>\n<h2>Properties of Ring Galaxies</h2>\n<div class=\"image-card-right\">\n    <p>So, what are some key features of these phenomenal galaxies? Starting with the most obvious property, a ring galaxy consists of a central core surrounded by a ring of luminous stars. However, between these layers, there exists a gap (shown in Fig. 2); a region of low density. Almost no stars and very little gas separates these two layers. The relatively compact core has a low gas composition and consists primarily of older stars [3]. Comparatively, the ring appears to be “bluer” than the core (due to the stronger concentration of short-lived blue stars), indicating that the stars within the ring were formed more recently. Additionally, when astronomers observed where these galaxies were generally located, they found that the galaxies were spread out in a region commonly referred to as “the field” [3] as opposed to the more central location of galaxy clusters.</p>\n    <div class=\"image\">\n        <div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative;

From her calculations, she found that the forces between the ring and the central core balance on the inner edge of the ring (shown in red in Fig. 3). She also calculated where the last stable circular orbit could occur (since the circulating object may be disturbed by the ring beyond a certain limit), finding a circular locus outside the core (see Fig.3). Between these two circles, there exists a space where circular orbits cannot exist. From these observations, scientists have been given an understanding towards why this gap between the ring and the core exists.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>A Brief History of Ring Galaxies</h2>\n<div class=\"image-card-right\">\n    <p>Dating back to 1950, the first ever ring galaxy, Hoag’s Object, was discovered by Art Hoag, baffling astronomers of its existence. At that time, the only method to making a ring-like object in space was where a central bright core was surrounded by a luminous halo i.e., a planetary nebula, such as the Ring Nebula in Fig. 4.<br><br>Over the years, the number of ring galaxies being discovered has multiplied drastically, especially recently, with the current number having increased to approximately 40,000. A project called “Galaxy Zoo” [6] recruited thousands of volunteers to identify the morphology of various galaxies [6], from which an AI algorithm, called “Zoobot” was produced. It utilised the inputs from these volunteers, and accurately identified galaxy shapes as well as predicting where it may be mistaken. This algorithm helped identify these ring galaxies, providing a dataset that can be used to reveal how galaxies evolve.</p> \n    <div class=\"image\">\n        <div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 397px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/d452241cd821f933fb11caf31c805b87/9157c/nebula.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 92.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Fig 4\" title=\"Fig 4\" src=\"/static/d452241cd821f933fb11caf31c805b87/9157c/nebula.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/d452241cd821f933fb11caf31c805b87/e07e9/nebula.jpg 200w,\n/static/d452241cd821f933fb11caf31c805b87/9157c/nebula.jpg 397w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div>\n        <em>Fig. 4 A composite image of the Ring Nebula [5]</em>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<h2>Formation of Hoag’s Object</h2>\n<div class=\"image-card-left\">\n    <div class=\"image\">\n        <div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/03479cecb25eb0203186d7e3111d0036/72f09/hoags.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 98%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Fig 5\" title=\"Fig 5\" src=\"/static/03479cecb25eb0203186d7e3111d0036/4b190/hoags.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/03479cecb25eb0203186d7e3111d0036/e07e9/hoags.jpg 200w,\n/static/03479cecb25eb0203186d7e3111d0036/066f9/hoags.jpg 400w,\n/static/03479cecb25eb0203186d7e3111d0036/4b190/hoags.jpg 800w,\n/static/03479cecb25eb0203186d7e3111d0036/72f09/hoags.jpg 886w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div>\n        <em>Hoag's Object, the first ring galaxy, discovered in 1950 [3]</em>\n    </div>\n    <p>There are several theories aiming to resolve the enigma of the formation of Hoag’s Object, some more elaborate than others.<br><br>\n    As mentioned earlier, Hoag’s Object (Fig.5) was first discovered in 1950, named after astronomer Arthur Hoag. When he first discovered this phenomenon, he explained that the “size and nucleus” were not of the typical planetary nebula, subsequently, labelling the object as a potential “new species” of galaxy [7]. Although he proposed other possible theories, including a diffraction effect or a gravitational lens system (occurs when a massive celestial object “bends” the path of light around it), he referred to them as “less probable explanations”.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Looking deeper into the structure of the object, the halo was observed to consist of young, blue stars, as opposed to the strong emission lines expected by a nebulae model, proving that Hoag’s object was of the galactic nature [3]. Furthermore, the idea of a gravitational lens or a diffraction phenomenon were both invalidated since the centre of the galaxy and the halo displayed identical redshifts, showing that they are both part of the same system [5]. So how is this galaxy formed?</p>\n<p>One theory includes the unstable bar model, proposed by Noah Brosch in 1985 [8], where the rotational velocity of the bar in a barred spiral galaxy increases to a certain point, until the bar structure becomes unstable, leading to a “spiral spin out”. This would result in a ring-like structure. The creation of the luminous halo of stars is due to the density waves from the unstable bar spreading out into a ring, also called a resonance ring [8]. As a result, the increase in pressure and gravitational force caused by the density waves promotes star formation, leaving behind a centre of older stars. However, in 1987, Schweizer et al. provided a strong counter argument against this theory; they detected a H I component (which informs us about the different processes that shape a galaxy) much larger than the upper limit within Brosch’s model [8], determining that the galaxy was in fact spheroidal, not disc-like which would be required for a bar instability to occur, disapproving of the Brosch hypothesis. Although it would be theoretically possible for a core to evolve from a disc shape into a spherical, they concluded that this scenario was unlikely [9]. Additionally, Brosch failed to detect remnants of a bar-like structure, further providing evidence against this theory.</p>\n<p>Another theory proposed was that of a collision between two galaxies. Schweizer also discussed this proposition. Using two telescopes (one for optical photometry and optical spectroscopy, the other being a radio telescope [9]), their observations established that the ring and the core had the same radial velocity and distance from the Earth, concluding that both the core and the ring must form a single object. Hence, this eliminated the collision hypothesis.</p>\n<p>Instead, Schweizer et al. put forward a new hypothesis – a major accretion event.</p>\n<p>They proposed that the structure of Hoag’s object was a result of a major accretion event 2-3 Gyr ago. In essence, this was an interaction between a massive elliptical galaxy and a much smaller galaxy, although not through a merging process or a collision. As a smaller galaxy comes into the gravitational influence of the larger galaxy, the smaller galaxy become stripped apart, resulting in a rounder core [4]. Schweizer et al. emphasised a lack of ripple or merging signatures, implying that this event could not have taken place recently, placing this event at least 2-3 billion years in the past. They also mentioned the presence of bright knots in the ring, which are aligned to a narrow ring that exists off-centre, suggesting that the ring is not completely settled.</p>\n<p>But how viable is this theory? Approaching the physical properties of the ring, analysis of the colours of the stars within the ring indicate a stellar population that is younger than 2 Gyr, which is consistent with this hypothesis. Additionally, by analysing the ionised gas velocity map [8], strong limits have been enforced on Hoag’s Object, although still consistent with the theory. However, by measuring the volume of gas in the ring, astronomers found out that it would not have been possible to accumulate that much stellar mass from a smaller galaxy that was hypothesised [4], ruling out this theory.</p>\n<p>Another group of scientists in 2011 [8] proposed a new theory where the core and the ring were formed separately. Starting with the core, the idea behind its formation is that it is a remnant from a cluster of galaxies that have merged together to form a spherical structure. Subsequently, the ring could be formed from the slow accretion of intergalactic medium [4] i.e., the gas remaining from the galaxies before the merge. This gas would theoretically circle around the core, and eventually start forming stars. An issue with this theory is that there is no explanation for why the gas would accrete into a ring instead of a disc, leaving a hole in this hypothesis.</p>\n<p>Since its discovery in 1950, the Hoag’s Object has puzzled astronomers. Theories of its formation have consistently appeared, causing controversial debates over this phenomenon. But over 70 years later, the “peculiar galaxy in Serpens” still remains a mystery.</p>\n<div id=\"bibliography\">\r\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\n<p>[1] Reynolds, M, Introduction to Astronomy, Available at: <a href=\"https://fscj.pressbooks.pub/introductionastronomy/\">https://fscj.pressbooks.pub/introductionastronomy/</a> (Accessed 12/08/2022)</p>\n<p>[2] NASA Hubble Site, Galaxies: The Building Blocks of the Universe, Available at: <a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/science/galaxies\">https://hubblesite.org/science/galaxies</a> (Accessed: 09/08/2022)</p>\n<p>[3] Siegel, E (2022), Ring galaxies, the rarest in the Universe, finally explained, Available at: <a href=\"https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/ring-galaxies-the-rarest-in-the-universe-finally-explained-ddb4ad6e2d33\">https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/ring-galaxies-the-rarest-in-the-universe-finally-explained-ddb4ad6e2d33</a> (Accessed: 09/08/2022)</p>\n<p>[4] Smethurst, R (2018), Hoag's Object | The Mystery of Ring Galaxies, Available at: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE46_wuj7P0\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE46_wuj7P0</a> (Accessed: 19/08/2022)</p>\n<p>[5] Siegel, E (2020), Astronomy's Most Perfect Ring Galaxy, Hoag's Object, Is Still A Mystery After 70 Years, Available at: <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2020/07/08/astronomys-most-perfect-ring-galaxy-hoags-object-is-still-a-mystery-after-70-years/\">https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2020/07/08/astronomys-most-perfect-ring-galaxy-hoags-object-is-still-a-mystery-after-70-years/</a> (Accessed: 10/08/2022)</p>\n<p>[6] Robinson, B (2022), Cyborg collaboration finds 40,000 ring galaxies, Available at: <a href=\"https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/cyborg-collaboration-finds-40000-ring-galaxies/\">https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/cyborg-collaboration-finds-40000-ring-galaxies/</a> (Accessed: 11/08/2022)</p>\n<p>[7] Hoag, A (1950), A peculiar object in Serpens, Available at: <a href=\"https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1950AJ.....55Q.170H\">https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1950AJ.....55Q.170H</a> (Accessed: 13/08/2022)</p>\n<p>[8] Finkelman et al.

Apollo 11 had just launched from Earth, and was carrying on board the first people to ever land on the Moon. It was a pivotal point for mankind, and marked as one of the greatest achievements of space travel, paving the way for many more accomplishments. Over 50 years later, we stand once more, on a pivotal point like no other. We are on the cusp of being able to colonise Mars, discover the secrets of new galaxies, and commercialise space travel for all. Let’s have a look at some of the ground-breaking ideas that will help us make these dreams reality.</p>\n<p>Firstly, let’s look at rockets. We currently use chemical thrusters to reach space, combusting liquid oxygen with liquid hydrogen. Although it gets the job done, it is extremely inefficient, as most of the weight of the rocket consists of fuel, and only 5% [1] of it is the payload- the object we want to actually send to space.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the future of rockets looks very bright, with lots of alternative fuel sources currently being proposed and researched into. As of now, the most successful projects are ones which use ion fuelled engines, better known as electric system engines, as they only use electricity to propel ions. Rather than lighting up liquid fuel to accelerate, ion fuelled engines spew ions at much faster velocities, and are significantly more efficient and longer lasting than chemical engines. The best chemical rockets have a fuel efficiency of around 35%, whereas ion rockets have an efficiency of 80-90%.

These high-speed electrons collide with and strip away the electrons from the xenon atoms, creating more free electrons as well as ionising xenon atoms into positively charged xenon ions (this is called an ionising event). This soup of positively charged xenon ions and negatively charged electrons is now in a state called plasma. Although this plasma has both positive ions and negative electrons, overall, the charge is neutral. This is known as quasi-neutral plasma. Electromagnetic fields and a high voltage are used to speed up and push out the ions from the discharge chamber and out of the thrusters at very high velocities, accelerating the spacecraft. Once out of the thrusters, an electron beam shoots out electrons in order to neutralise the xenon ions, so they don’t strip electrons from the spacecraft itself. The electromagnetic fields keep the extra electrons within the discharge chamber, increasing the ionising events, making it more efficient. They also minimise the electrons hitting the walls of the chamber in order to increase the engine’s durability. This whole system is powered by solar panels, so no battery or power system is needed, minimising the total weight of the spacecraft.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"image-card-right\">\n    <p>Although these ion thrusters don’t produce as much thrust as chemical rockets, and can’t yet be used to escape Earth’s gravity well, they can last for months at full throttle (until they run out of fuel). This makes them extremely efficient in space, where there’s no gravity or air resistance, and slowly accelerating a spacecraft for weeks adds up the velocity, allowing it to travel at incredibly high velocities after just a couple of weeks of constant acceleration. A chemical rocket has a maximum velocity of around 40,000 mph. On the other hand, ion engines reach a velocity of 100,000mph, and NASA is researching and developing an ion engine which can theoretically reach up to 500,000mph. [3] Ion engines are already used in many satellites in order to keep them in orbit, and were used to propel NASA’s Dawn spacecraft (launched in 2007) deep into our solar system. Dawn was the first spacecraft to orbit two objects in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter: The protoplanets Vesta and Ceres.</p>\n    <div class=\"image\"><div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 546px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/bedc1720c0148c347c78d748ef2dde04/f066e/spacestation.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 55.99999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Spacecraft\" title=\"Spacecraft\" src=\"/static/bedc1720c0148c347c78d748ef2dde04/f066e/spacestation.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/bedc1720c0148c347c78d748ef2dde04/e07e9/spacestation.jpg 200w,\n/static/bedc1720c0148c347c78d748ef2dde04/066f9/spacestation.jpg 400w,\n/static/bedc1720c0148c347c78d748ef2dde04/f066e/spacestation.jpg 546w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"image-card-right\">\n    <p>To summarise, chemical engines are used up very quickly. The Falcon Heavy is about 550 metric tonnes, and 400 metric tonnes of it is fuel. This fuel is entirely consumed in 9.5 minutes [1], at which point the payload is in space. Whilst chemical rockets are still the easiest way to send objects into space, a typical mission to Mars will take about 9 months, because the spacecraft cannot afford to use any more fuel to accelerate in space, and will simply cruise its way to Mars. However, spacecraft utilising both chemical rockets to enter space, and ion engines to gain additional velocity in space, can reach Mars in just over a month, cutting travel times by nearly 90%. Ion engines hold lots of potential, and NASA are in the final stages of testing and improving their endurance and reliability, so we can use them on manned spacecraft.</p>\n    <div class=\"image\"><div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 485px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/c9f9d769e30ba73b25b237f445730798/44c61/Falcon.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 48.50000000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Falcon\" title=\"Falcon\" src=\"/static/c9f9d769e30ba73b25b237f445730798/44c61/Falcon.png\" srcset=\"/static/c9f9d769e30ba73b25b237f445730798/772e8/Falcon.png 200w,\n/static/c9f9d769e30ba73b25b237f445730798/e17e5/Falcon.png 400w,\n/static/c9f9d769e30ba73b25b237f445730798/44c61/Falcon.png 485w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div></div>\n</div>\n<p>We already know that even though chemical rockets are our only way of going to space, they are very expensive and relatively inefficient. Luckily for us, there could be another way to go to space: Skyhooks.\r\nSkyhooks are a simple and extremely effective method of sending objects into space. Currently, a rocket has to travel about 400km to deliver a payload into low orbit, such as the ISS. This takes a considerable amount of fuel and money, even more so if you are trying to fly to another planet. A skyhook could make it so you only have to fly 20% of the distance, and the skyhook would throw you into space.</p>\n<div class=\"image-card-left\">\n    <div class=\"image\"><div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 546px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/0147c6434183c390ef04fc3f3d326d81/76aed/Skyhook.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 53%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Sky hook\" title=\"Sky hook\" src=\"/static/0147c6434183c390ef04fc3f3d326d81/76aed/Skyhook.png\" srcset=\"/static/0147c6434183c390ef04fc3f3d326d81/772e8/Skyhook.png 200w,\n/static/0147c6434183c390ef04fc3f3d326d81/e17e5/Skyhook.png 400w,\n/static/0147c6434183c390ef04fc3f3d326d81/76aed/Skyhook.png 546w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div></div>\n    <p>But what actually is a skyhook? Put simply, a skyhook is a giant spinning tether, with a counterweight on it. This superstructure would have two ends, the lowest about 80km above earth’s surface, and the highest about 1000km above earth. The craft would dock to its tether at the lowest point, and gain angular momentum as the skyhook rotated, as well as orbiting earth. Once the tether has reached its highest point, the craft would be released and propelled into space, carrying extra velocity from the skyhook. This not only reduces the fuel needed to send satellites and such into space, but also allows us to travel quicker and further, as almost all fuel is used to get out of Earth’s gravity well.  If we can use this alternative, we can conserve our fuel and use it to travel in space itself faster. We can even build skyhooks to orbit the Moon, or even Mars, using one of its Moons as a counterweight, and making a much larger skyhook to catapult us to the far depths of our solar system, at a much more affordable price and shorter time frame.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"image-card-right\">\n    <p>Despite this seemingly archaic idea to catapult things into space, the science behind the skyhook is sound, and it is even possible to create it with our current technology! There are many materials that are contenders to be used in the making of the tether, with a material called Zylon [4] in the lead. Zylon is extremely heat-resistant, a crucial feature as the bottom of the space tether is still in the Earth’s atmosphere, and will experience some air resistance and a lot of friction. Fortunately, at 80km above the Earth’s surface, the atmosphere is very thin and air resistance is bearable for the superstructure. Zylon is also over one and half times stronger than Kevlar, and barely changes length when put under intense tensions. All very useful properties to face space debris and endurance testing. Using the law of conservation of momentum, every time a skyhook sends a spacecraft into space, in order for the spacecraft to move faster, the superstructure will impart some of its own momentum on the spacecraft, slowing its own momentum. If this continues to happen, the skyhook will stop rotating and may even fall out of the sky and crash down to earth. This is why there will be small boosters (similar to the ones currently on satellites) to replenish the skyhook's momentum. Another way we can keep the skyhooks in the air is by doing the reverse of what we already do, as this would give energy to the skyhook, essentially replenishing its angular momentum. This would occur by “catching” high speed spacecraft in high orbit as they come back to Earth, slowing them down, and releasing them in low orbit. If done right, this can make skyhooks entirely self-sustaining, meaning they become more cost-effective the more we use them.</p>\n    <div class=\"image\"><div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 612px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/436bb4c440479b3c00bf86846de6addf/8c76f/Planets.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 53%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Planets\" title=\"Planets\" src=\"/static/436bb4c440479b3c00bf86846de6addf/8c76f/Planets.png\" srcset=\"/static/436bb4c440479b3c00bf86846de6addf/772e8/Planets.png 200w,\n/static/436bb4c440479b3c00bf86846de6addf/e17e5/Planets.png 400w,\n/static/436bb4c440479b3c00bf86846de6addf/8c76f/Planets.png 612w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"image-card-left\">\n    <div class=\"image\"><div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 413px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/0509911d76025f277ba8efe76080c093/6c1e7/Hubble.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 72.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Hubble\" title=\"Hubble\" src=\"/static/0509911d76025f277ba8efe76080c093/6c1e7/Hubble.png\" srcset=\"/static/0509911d76025f277ba8efe76080c093/772e8/Hubble.png 200w,\n/static/0509911d76025f277ba8efe76080c093/e17e5/Hubble.png 400w,\n/static/0509911d76025f277ba8efe76080c093/6c1e7/Hubble.png 413w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 413px) 100vw, 413px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div></div>\n    <p>Since skyhooks can reduce the flight distance by about 80%, rockets can also be around 80% [5] smaller and considerably cheaper, although they will be remodelled so they can fly to and get caught by skyhooks. With the addition of skyhooks on other celestial bodies too, skyhooks could make future space travel cheaper and even commercialised, with planets such as Mars only one skyhook away. Skyhooks on a much smaller scale have already been tested and put into space, with great success, so it's only a matter of time before space agencies invest in creating these superstructures. With a bit of luck, and a lot of hard work, we may see the commercialisation of space travel happen very soon.</p>\n</div>\n<p>So far, we’ve seen technology that can be implemented within this century, with the concepts being very realistic. What about something more… theoretical?</p>\n<p>Introducing wormholes.</p>\n<p>Wormholes are a special phenomenon, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, could exist. They are essentially doorways to a different part of the universe, whether that be a few metres apart, or billions of light years away. Using Einstein’s theory of general relativity [6], we can see that the mathematics checks out, and that they can indeed exist. But just because something can exist in theory, it doesn’t mean it necessarily does exist in reality, and we have not (yet) found any naturally existing wormholes. But first, some explanation and context of what wormholes and general relativity are.</p>\n<div class=\"image-card-right\">\n    <p>The theory of general relativity, simply put, is a way of describing how gravity works, and is our best description of it till this day. One key concept is how the very fabric of space-time works. Imagine if space-time is a trampoline. On its own, its flat, and there is no curvature. If I put a kettlebell on it, it will bend, and depending on the weight and shape of the kettlebell, it will curve differently. This is exactly how space-time works; objects such as stars and planets have a volume and gravity, and this gravity curves space-time. We already know that blackholes exist, and that they have such a strong gravity, warping space-time to the point where even light, the fastest thing in the universe, cannot escape its grasp.</p>\n    <div class=\"image\"><div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 315px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/bdc3bb851186e65fe79166dd95aab874/a6688/Generalrelativity.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 132.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"General relativity\" title=\"General relativity\" src=\"/static/bdc3bb851186e65fe79166dd95aab874/a6688/Generalrelativity.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/bdc3bb851186e65fe79166dd95aab874/e07e9/Generalrelativity.jpg 200w,\n/static/bdc3bb851186e65fe79166dd95aab874/a6688/Generalrelativity.jpg 315w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"image-card-left\">\n    <div class=\"image\"><div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 540px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/c834caf33203fadfa870e64df9de16ae/09d21/Wormhole.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Wormhole\" title=\"Wormhole\" src=\"/static/c834caf33203fadfa870e64df9de16ae/09d21/Wormhole.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/c834caf33203fadfa870e64df9de16ae/e07e9/Wormhole.jpg 200w,\n/static/c834caf33203fadfa870e64df9de16ae/066f9/Wormhole.jpg 400w,\n/static/c834caf33203fadfa870e64df9de16ae/09d21/Wormhole.jpg 540w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div></div>\n    <p>But what if we took the trampoline and curved it so much that two opposite ends meet, and then we punch a hole through that? This is what wormholes do. They warp space-time so much that the space-time between two far apart places creases in on itself, and upon creating a hole through this crease, you have essentially closed the distance to virtually nothing. Another way of visualising this is if you think of the universe in 2D, as a big flat sheet. If this sheet is bent in just the right way, a wormhole can be created through the sheet. This method is technically faster than the speed of light itself, as you have taken a much shorter route.</p>\n</div>\n<p>As you can see, even though the maths behind wormholes checks out, in reality it does sound like science fiction. But what if instead of looking for wormholes, we try something crazier. We could try to make them ourselves.</p>\n<div class=\"image-card-right\">\n    <p>In order to create a traversable wormhole (a wormhole we can freely travel through back and forth), we need three main criteria. Firstly, we need them to connect two distant places, such as Earth and Saturn. Secondly, they should have an entry and exist, without any event horizons, like blackholes, as that would make travel impossible. Lastly, they need to be big enough so that humans can travel through them without the G-forces killing us. The hardest part will be to keep our wormholes open. No matter how big our wormholes may be, the gravitational forces acting on the wormhole will be so strong that it will always be forced closed, unless we have some material that is strong enough to go against gravity to keep it open. This material has to have unique properties; the properties of exotic matter. Exotic matter is nothing like any matter we have seen previously, or even antimatter, which consists of the antiparticles of the particles of mass. Exotic matter has negative mass, meaning it will be able to repel any matter, and essentially repel against gravity itself. Surprisingly, this doesn’t introduce any violation of the laws of conservation and energy, and are still mathematically consistent. This would be able to hold up our wormhole, and make not only space travel, but any sort of travel at all, reach new and unprecedented heights. There are even some exotic atoms and exotic hadrons, as well as other elements which may possess the properties of exotic matter. [7] However, some scientists believe that if you can travel faster than the speed of light, that means time travel should be possible, and this would break our fundamental laws of physics. For this reason, many believe that not wormholes cannot be found or created.</p>\n    <div class=\"image\"><div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 519px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/af56a485c1e62171b683edc88b7a345e/eac85/Conservation.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 50.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAKABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMF/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAc1JXRVIf//EABcQAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERACD/2gAIAQEAAQUCjHKPH//EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAR/9oACAEDAQE/Aaf/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAECAQE/AT//xAAaEAACAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQEgITFB/9oACAEBAAY/Anw2YhU//8QAGhABAQACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREAIRBBYf/aAAgBAQABPyFAs2YOQSBpvzGDoZef/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABA77//EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR/9oACAEDAQE/EKV//8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREA/9oACAECAQE/EK4YTf/EABwQAQEAAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERACExURBBsf/aAAgBAQABPxBTIqDSnP3CesjAldbxYiAJbXvK4rD1l8f/2Q=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Conservation\" title=\"Conservation\" src=\"/static/af56a485c1e62171b683edc88b7a345e/eac85/Conservation.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/af56a485c1e62171b683edc88b7a345e/e07e9/Conservation.jpg 200w,\n/static/af56a485c1e62171b683edc88b7a345e/066f9/Conservation.jpg 400w,\n/static/af56a485c1e62171b683edc88b7a345e/eac85/Conservation.jpg 519w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div></div>\n</div>\n<p>For now, wormholes exist only on paper, and in our dreams.

Authentic Consent &#x26; The Problem of Consent to Harm</h2>\n<p>Before considering how consent functions in moral cases, it must first be articulated what consent actually is. Basically conceived, consent is “an act of permitting something to be done or of recognizing some authority”[1].</p>\n<p>In limiting our question to concern of consenting acts involving adults though, we tacitly recognise some limits on consent differentiating it from mere assent. We rightly restrict children to being incapable of consent; in On Liberty, Mill writes that personal sovereignty (and therefore consent) is the preserve only of “human beings in maturity of their faculties”[2]. By the same principle, we might similarly deem those with severe mental health conditions to be incapable of consent[3], or those whose faculties are only temporarily impaired, for example, if they are drunk. Clearly, there is some threshold of freedom and rationality before which an agent’s consent is inauthentic.</p>\n<p>Mill justifies that it is right to restrict someone’s capacity of consent in cases where they “must be protected against their own actions”, implying that, upon the recognition that consent is at least intended as a moral sanction for action, there is a need to avoid sanctioning damage resulting from some irrational agent to their own harm[4].</p>\n<p>Such an analysis immediately brings into question though whether an adult – specifically one who we would normally consider to be free and rational – can be deprived of consent on the same basis as children though, given that generally rational adults often do consent to their own harm. This problem will form the basis of the objections discussed in this essay whereby the view that consent is capable of absolving wrongdoing may be rejected - the problem that substantially rational adults are demonstrably capable of consenting harms (or at least to minor harms) to themselves.</p>\n<p>There are certain cases, such as rape, in which the harm involved is itself dependent on consent, and which consent would substantially transform or annul[5]. However, there is a majority of harms a person might consent to (for example, consenting to being hit) in which consent does nothing to alleviate the harm experienced in the act. At least according to a pointedly consequentialist view of ethics then, there is a justified default position here that consent does necessarily hold any moral significance. Acts involving only consenting adults may be morally wrong under the same conditions as any other act – the condition that they incur more moral harm than good.</p>\n<p>To argue the contrary – that consent can annul moral harm – we require some more general principle of liberty, which defends a fundamental right for someone to act upon her own consent, and allow others to do the same to her also upon her consent; where she can decide which ethical duties apply to her.</p>\n<h2>II. The Harm Principle</h2>\n<p>Mill presents this kind of right in his ‘Harm Principle’, which states that “the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant.”[7]. This principle, at first, seems to arise in respect of a fundamental concept of personal liberty, about which Mill writes “In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign”[8].</p>\n<p>As personal liberty entails that our sole moral limit is in acting upon other people, consent is defended as absolute, and annulling culpability for moral harm, both in the case of harming one’s self, and in the case where one devolves their allowance to harm themselves to another in accordance with their “free, voluntary, and undeceived consent and participation”[9].</p>\n<p>There is a problematic sense though, in which the Harm Principle is both a fundamental expression of liberty, and simultaneously not about liberty at all. Mill’s real justification for the absolute moral legitimacy of consent is not on the basis any “abstract” libertarian right, but rather given a utilitarian slant which makes liberty merely instrumental in achieving wider utilitarian ends (principally avoiding governmental tyranny). Regardless of whether the Harm Principle is justified as a political right – where politics may be taken as ethics in the context of society as a whole - there is a clear disconnect between such ideas and the purely ethical realm. From Mill’s own consequentialist perspective, it is still the case that action between consenting agents may be wrong, provided that it is sufficiently isolated from wider society, and therefore Mill does not actually defend the moral impunity involved in acts of consent on an absolute basis.</p>\n<h2>III. Kantian Liberty – the Sovereignty Principle</h2>\n<p>At the core of this tension whereby the Harm Principle functions best for political but not ethical legislation is also Mill’s “negative” concept of liberty – a concept of liberty as deriving from the absence of external limits on a person’s individual powers[10]. While there is a strong case that freedom (and the value of consent) must be defended from external limits in any concept of liberty, the concept fails unless this is done on the basis of a positive libertarian axiom, not just under the threat of the tyranny brought about by abandoning liberty, as Mill expresses. This negative basis ultimately dissolves into a fundamentally anti-libertarian, consequentialist ethical system. To form a coherent basis for universally justifying consent, liberty as such must manifest as both a fundamental political and an ethical concept.</p>\n<p>It is also through this inconsistent relationship with liberty that the Harm Principle, intending to justify the “wrongless harms” involved when someone consents to their harm, becomes vulnerable the problem of “harmless wrongs.” In “Beyond the Harm Principle”, Arthur Ripstein’s argument against Mill is structured around the example of a person who invades someone’s home and takes a nap there, without damaging the home or tangibly setting back the owner’s interests in anyway[11] . In this case, there clearly is some principled moral wrong involved, associated with a violation of the homeowner’s liberty without consent. However, the Harm Principle fails to legislate against this on account of its utilitarian basis: it must hold that there is no harm to the homeowner, so there is no wrong. Generally, the Harm Principle suffers on account of being incapable of prohibiting any violation, so long as it does not actually manifest in harm.</p>\n<p>In recognition that avoidance of harm cannot be an exclusive basis for wrongdoing, Ripstein exchanges a utilitarian justification for liberty with a Kantian one, in which freedom is grounded in the inherent dignity of the human as an end-in-itself[12].From this he derives the “Sovereignty Principle”, which states that “The only legitimate restrictions on conduct are those that secure mutual independence of free persons from each other”[13]. Through this principle, harmless wrongs such as the home-invasion are successfully prohibited on the basis that the wrongdoer has placed the victim (or, in this case, the victim’s property, over which they are also sovereign) as a mere means, violating the independence and sovereignty of the victim.</p>\n<p>This “Sovereignty Principle” provides a much stronger basis for moral impunity in the case of consenting harm. An individual’s sovereignty entails that they can choose, via consent, which ethical duties apply to themselves. Therefore, whenever an agent consents to something done to them, what is done to them is in accordance with their choice and their interests, and therefore their dignity as ends-in-themselves, and their independence is never violated, regardless of the context of the specific harm which troubles Mill’s principle.</p>\n<p>When they consent to their own harm, “any harm that ensues is not an interference with sovereignty. Other harms do interfere with sovereignty, but it is that interference, not their harmfulness, that merits prohibition”[14].</p>\n<h2>IV. Consent in Violation of Human Dignity</h2>\n<p>While this concept that one’s dignity can never be infringed upon according to consent seems intuitively reasonable, there is an important objection in the case of particularly grave harms. This is not merely on the consequentialist basis articulated in the introduction to the essay, although it could be argued that the extent of the harms effected by certain consensual acts might be so great as to exceed the value of maintaining any principle of liberty. Instead, there may be cases in which some harm is so extreme as to infringe upon a consenting subject’s liberty, and further than this, their human dignity itself, purely by virtue of the gravity of the harm.</p>\n<p>Ripstein only entertains that freedom can be wrongly restricted, and human dignity degraded as the result of one actor enforcing their will upon another and the things over which they are sovereign. However, in “The Moral Limits of Consent as a Defense in the Criminal Law” Dennis Baker argues a harm like death can clearly destroy our human dignity in of itself to a far greater extent than anyone else’s decision to use us for their own ends, and it is because of this that consent is an unreasonable justification for murder[15].</p>\n<p>In his articulation of the humanity principle, Kant himself explains that we are “not at liberty to dispose of that humanity which constitutes my person, either by killing, maiming, or mutilating it,” on the basis that even the subject of a harm is capable, in consenting to the harm, of treating herself as a mere means and thus, infringing upon their own sovereignty[16].</p>\n<p>In response to this, Ripstein simply recognises that the Sovereignty Principle has “no resource to prohibit suicide, as it does not involve domination”, providing only an argument against consent to murder by an external agent[17]. However, both the problem of suicide and the problem of consent to one’s own murder are of equal significance from this Kantian perspective as, in moving from suicide to consenting murder, while the structure of culpability might be altered, it is still the same ultimate ethical rights and consequences which are at stake.</p>\n<p>It is my view that Ripstein misses a significant objection to this though, which is that Kant and Baker, in arguing that an agent is capable of consenting to the degradation of their own dignity, misrepresent what constitutes authentic consent. Particularly, they do not rightly consider whether such agents satisfy the condition of rationality as established at the beginning of this essay. For example, Baker recognises that we have an inalienable right to life and yet he conceives of a rational agent could deny this right while maintaining the rationality needed to be capable of consent[18]. I believe it also more widely evident that, in any of the cases Kant presents – the desire to kill, maim, or mutilate one’s self – such desires are always the consequence of some mental disorder.</p>\n<p>Obviously an agent’s requirement for rationality for consent is not absolute; there is irrationality which may be permissibly involved in any exercise of personal autonomy. But there is a central and dangerous irrationality necessary for them to degrade their own dignity involved when one treats one’s self as a mere means, forgoing any ethical duty to their own life, and general humanity, which certainly precludes them from consent.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, if the purpose of consent is to represent one’s fundamental interests, and an agent’s interests fundamental are not being represented in the act they consent to (i.e. in one in which they treat themselves as a mere means), it is clear consent has been misattributed.</p>\n<h2>V. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In general then, while it has been shown there is a valid defence of consent as providing moral immunity via the positive, libertarian basis of the Sovereignty Principle, we must also recognise there is an extent to which this libertarian ideal restricts consent; it introduces a rational threshold through which we must pass to gain it. On the basis of the Sovereignty Principle then, we can conclude that the acts of consenting adults are never morally wrong, so long as we are aware that consent is held only on the condition that we do not abuse it in degrading our own dignity.</p>\n<div id=\"bibliography\">\r\n<h2>References</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>King, L.

I like to think of Key Poses as the default poses and the “extreme” poses, where the extreme poses would be the ones with the most change from the base poses. You can see that Frame 5 presents a drastic change to the default pose as the legs are fully stretched and the character experiences the greatest change in position.</p>\n<p>Besides the leg movement, the sequence above still looks very static: the main body is pretty much just sliding up and down. When a person applies any form of movement, we would always expect their body to react to that motion in some way.</p>\n<p>One way we could present recoil on the main body would be to use a technique called <strong>Squash-and-Stretch</strong>, a common technique used to exaggerate motion and make it more visible. You could imagine a character as being an elastic object: a default pose is like an unstretched rubber ball and applying a force to it would squash the features of the character, then removing that force would cause the character to stretch before going back to the default pose.</p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n    <div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 334px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/7b1cace08f936762b815abdee3d960df/86d36/SquashAndStretch.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 40%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAICAYAAAD5nd/tAAAACXBIWXMAAA7DAAAOwwHHb6hkAAABFElEQVQoz21RW46DMAzk/seDjyICaYMo6qpSSQLkAbSzsneDUFtLlu144sw4GQBs24Z5nvF8PqnE6/ViT5Zy6ocQ9vobLqPEOYeyLOG9/wAec2st6rreccnWdUWMkfMsXRrHcT98Z3ZkqLXGsixcG2MgpUTbtuj7nvtZAtMr1CTpxODI9hhpPTSACAzDwA8QEVoFM0ySCPhzu0EIgTzP0XXdziphkiulUBTFh/R9h8m0MTzwMQy4KIX4L+3dnPe49v3XXkYSrdaYrMW5aaCkxKg1x8f9jmmaWF5ywjVVhep0wmQMY+k+fSwPjLSvtkW4XBCqCl5KhPMZsa4RlOLdBO//onMITQMvBJwQnHPddYjrSprxC6C9a7M6o8aoAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Squash and stretch\" title=\"Squash and stretch\" src=\"/static/7b1cace08f936762b815abdee3d960df/86d36/SquashAndStretch.png\" srcset=\"/static/7b1cace08f936762b815abdee3d960df/772e8/SquashAndStretch.png 200w,\n/static/7b1cace08f936762b815abdee3d960df/86d36/SquashAndStretch.png 334w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 334px) 100vw, 334px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div>\n    <em class=\"centre\">Squash-And-Stretch by Ralph A.

Depending on how much stretch an object experiences when they move could be used to demonstrate their weight and stiffness. If your object is very stretchy it could imply that they’re soft, otherwise the object is sturdy. It’s not natural for an object to be able to stretch over an infinite distance. So, when you’re applying Squash-and-Stretch, try to keep size proportions believable, which is normally done to keep the object’s volume consistent. Therefore, the amount of squash should be perpendicular to the amount of stretch.</p>\n<div class=\"image\">\r\n    <div class=\"vid\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/3FtLPf5Luy1YsL8l6O\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\"></iframe></div>\r\n</div>\n<div class=\"image\">\n    <div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 718px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/54ea5a177c8b7800c73348703a4b7e43/57dc1/SquashKeyframes.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 20%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Squash and stretch jumping plant plot key frames\" title=\"Squash and stretch jumping plant plot key frames\" src=\"/static/54ea5a177c8b7800c73348703a4b7e43/57dc1/SquashKeyframes.png\" srcset=\"/static/54ea5a177c8b7800c73348703a4b7e43/772e8/SquashKeyframes.png 200w,\n/static/54ea5a177c8b7800c73348703a4b7e43/e17e5/SquashKeyframes.png 400w,\n/static/54ea5a177c8b7800c73348703a4b7e43/57dc1/SquashKeyframes.png 718w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 718px) 100vw, 718px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div>\n    <em class=\"centre\">Look at Frames 2 and 8, where the body gets squashed the most. Let’s assume that squash reduces the vertical height by 4 pixels—so we would want to stretch the body horizontally by 4 pixels to maintain the volume of the shape (2 pixels to the right, and 2 pixels to the left).</em>\n</div>\n<p>This looks more expressive than before since the character’s main body now shows impact from the jump. We could still do better by improving on the movement of the smaller details to give more energy to the character animation. An aspect of the design I decided to improve on was the soil part of the character, as after all, he is a sentient pot-being. One goofy little change would be to make the soil move up and down when he jumps and falls.</p>\n<p>We could suggest that based on the character design, the amount of soil that he carries is probably not as heavy as his main pot body therefore they both have different weights. With that in mind, it’s safe to assume that the main body would fall at a faster rate than the soil. In other words, there is an offset between when both of these things would move. This behavior is normally called <strong>Overlapping</strong> or <strong>Overlapping-Action</strong> which is commonly associated with <strong>Follow-Through</strong>. Follow-Through is the idea that some parts (or limbs) attached to a main body could continue to move even after the main body has halted. Another way of looking at how these two things work would be to imagine exaggerating inertia. Realistically the connected part should move at the same pace as the main body due to inertia, however, Overlapping and Follow-Through applies a delay in movement of the connected part.</p>\n<div class=\"image\">\r\n    <div class=\"vid\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/LlkoHQ0pL4Fjsfs745\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\"></iframe></div>\r\n</div>\n<div class=\"image\">\n    <div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 718px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/3ecdd361f40ea34af92305d82dbdd808/57dc1/OverlappingKeyframes.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 20%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Overlapping jumping plant plot key frames\" title=\"Overlapping jumping plant plot key frames\" src=\"/static/3ecdd361f40ea34af92305d82dbdd808/57dc1/OverlappingKeyframes.png\" srcset=\"/static/3ecdd361f40ea34af92305d82dbdd808/772e8/OverlappingKeyframes.png 200w,\n/static/3ecdd361f40ea34af92305d82dbdd808/e17e5/OverlappingKeyframes.png 400w,\n/static/3ecdd361f40ea34af92305d82dbdd808/57dc1/OverlappingKeyframes.png 718w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 718px) 100vw, 718px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div>\n    <em class=\"centre\">If you look at Frame 4, you can see how the grass hair is shorter than the other frames.

In Frame 5, when the main body reaches the peak height, the soil continues to move higher. The following frames demonstrate the difference in falling speed between the two objects.</em>\n</div>\n<p>This final section of the article can’t be done properly using our sequence because there isn’t really any quick movement involved. However, I think it’s a really useful skill nonetheless as it may help reduce the workload immensely.</p>\n<p>In animation, it’s difficult to have the time and resources to make our movement super smooth and we don’t need to (for the most part)! If the changes are so small between a frame and its previous frames, there’s no reason to spend a lot of effort trying to perfect each and every one of them. You don’t want to end up creating 1000 frames to make the smoothest animation but you also don’t want too few frames to cover that sequence. It’s pretty subjective on what is “enough frames” for a sequence, since that depends on personal preference, but just avoid spending too long on it—otherwise you end up stagnating at one little shot in your project.</p>\n<p>Most animated films typically run on 24-30 frames per second, so it’s generally hard for anyone to notice any minor changes between the current frame and the previous frames. So, one method to save money and development time is through the use of a technique called <strong>Smearing</strong>, which is applying motion blurs on our animation. Be aware that smearing frames look weird on their own. Some examples of smearing:</p>\n<div class=\"multi-image-row-2\">\n    <div class=\"image\"><div class=\"vid\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/BndJJCXqdANurcPcEq\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\"></iframe></div><em>3D Smearing Example : Candyman from Lethal League Blaze</em></div>\n    <div class=\"image\"><div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 267px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/c86930997702998656b2feabf00f2299/19e8f/DaffyDuck.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 74%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Dafft duck\" title=\"Dafft duck\" src=\"/static/c86930997702998656b2feabf00f2299/19e8f/DaffyDuck.png\" srcset=\"/static/c86930997702998656b2feabf00f2299/772e8/DaffyDuck.png 200w,\n/static/c86930997702998656b2feabf00f2299/19e8f/DaffyDuck.png 267w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div><em>2D Smearing Example : Daffy Duck</em></div>\n</div>\n<p>Motion blurs occur when we try to maintain focus on a fast-moving object. It’s impossible to spot every change in our view so our brains extrapolate the movement which results in the object looking smudged to us. A use of smearing would be in consecutive frames that look too alike, you could essentially reduce the number of frames to a few and smear those frames afterwards. There are a lot of creative ways you could implement smearing. One of them is to use smearing to highlight the strength of the movement, like using thick blurs at the end of a moving sword to show a heavy slash.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this small guide has been helpful in informing you about some of the techniques you could use in animation.</p>\n<div id=\"bibliography\">\r\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>Overlapping-Action by Alan Becker: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OxphYV8W3E&#x26;ab_channel=AlanBeckerTutorials\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OxphYV8W3E&#x26;ab_channel=AlanBeckerTutorials</a></p>\n<p>Pose To Animation by Jazza: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcBwDHx_oDk&#x26;ab_channel=Jazza\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcBwDHx_oDk&#x26;ab_channel=Jazza</a></p>\n<p>Overlapping-Action Guide by Animation Mentor: <a href=\"https://www.animationmentor.com/blog/follow-through-and-overlapping-action-the-12-basic-principles-of-animation/\">https://www.animationmentor.com/blog/follow-through-and-overlapping-action-the-12-basic-principles-of-animation/</a></p>\n<p>Squash-And-Stretch by Animation Mentor: <a href=\"https://www.animationmentor.com/blog/squash-and-stretch-the-12-basic-principles-of-animation/\">https://www.animationmentor.com/blog/squash-and-stretch-the-12-basic-principles-of-animation/</a></p>\n<p>Animation Smearing by IdeaRocket: <a href=\"https://idearocketanimation.com/8857-animation-techniques-smear/\">https://idearocketanimation.com/8857-animation-techniques-smear/</a></p>\n<p>Squash-And-Stretch by Ralph A.

When asked to imagine a typical therapeutic agent, our ideas often spring to ‘white pills’ or ‘strawberry flavoured Calpol’. However, within the realms of biological synthesis lies a promising category of future treatment – in vivo manufacture and delivery of therapeutics via <u>genetically modified bacteria</u>. Whilst still in its relative infancy, its potential is derived from the ability to harness the natural metabolic and genetic cycles of the therapeutic bacteria, influencing its interaction with the human cellular environment, its specificity to the disease cell target and the synthesis of therapeutic agent to be deliver to the diseased cell. In a time of precision medicine, where scientists are searching to amplify and improve drug-target interaction, this innate capability of GM-bacteria is of paramount importance.</p>\n<p>In its essence, the purpose of a medicinal drug is the selective elimination of diseased cells (or disease causing compounds), in conjunction with minimal damage to the surrounding tissue. This is a longstanding principle with origins rooted in Ehrlich’s ‘Magic Bullet’ - a term he used to describe the concept that chemicals could be designed to bind to and kill specific microbes or tumour cells. Hence, when designing the mechanisms of a GM bacteria drug delivery system, the pharmacological necessities of efficient therapeutic delivery must first be outlined.</p>\n<p>These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an optimisation of therapeutic effect and reduction of side effects via specificity of the therapeutic to the target site, resulting in high concentration at the target and low concentration in non-target areas</li>\n<li>a predictable drug release pattern, with minimal leakage during transport</li>\n<li>easy bodily elimination of the drug</li>\n<li>non-toxicity, non-immunogenicity, biodegradability, biochemical inertness, biocompatibility and physicochemical stability in vivo and vitro.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Supplementing these core foundations are multiple other factors, influencing the success of in vivo bacterial delivery. Such benefits are again derived from the precise attack mechanism, meaning a lower drug dosage is required, in turn reducing any subsequent side effects. Further to this, by genetically defining the precise intracellular production process, both the need for product purification is removed and the capability for combination therapy (i.e. the synthesis of multiple drugs by a singular bacterium), is introduced, engendering greater efficacy and efficiency of treatment.</p>\n<div class=\"multi-image-row-2\">\n    <div class=\"image\"><div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 563px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/8de50bcc4a60042e28a7e464b6b96fd2/6808d/bacteria.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 55.00000000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Bacteria\" title=\"Bacteria\" src=\"/static/8de50bcc4a60042e28a7e464b6b96fd2/6808d/bacteria.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/8de50bcc4a60042e28a7e464b6b96fd2/e07e9/bacteria.jpg 200w,\n/static/8de50bcc4a60042e28a7e464b6b96fd2/066f9/bacteria.jpg 400w,\n/static/8de50bcc4a60042e28a7e464b6b96fd2/6808d/bacteria.jpg 563w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div></div>\n    <div class=\"image\"><div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 564px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/5c8ea42deff12e258a5003968b189807/7723c/process.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 55.49999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Process\" title=\"Process\" src=\"/static/5c8ea42deff12e258a5003968b189807/7723c/process.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/5c8ea42deff12e258a5003968b189807/e07e9/process.jpg 200w,\n/static/5c8ea42deff12e258a5003968b189807/066f9/process.jpg 400w,\n/static/5c8ea42deff12e258a5003968b189807/7723c/process.jpg 564w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div>\n</div></div>\n<h2>Drug Delivery Mechanisms in Bacteria:</h2>\n<p>The mechanism can be subdivided into three key components: targeting the diseased tissue once the drug is within the localised area, production and delivery of the active compound, and termination of treatment. Enabling these stages are complex genetic circuits, constructed in the bacteria prior to bodily entry, that result in altered metabolic pathways that not only synthesise the desired protein but code for sensing, signalling and lysis in the delivery system.</p>\n<h3>1. Targeting of the specific disease site:</h3>\n<p>Before direct targeting of the disease site can occur, the bacterial complex must first enter the body, which in some cases is by a singular subcutaneous injection to the localised area of the disease.</p>\n<p>In a healthy cellular environment, there is a constant influx and output of chemical signals and compounds, maintained by the instruction of each cell’s genetic code. However, when an infectious agent enters a cell, or genetic mutations arise (as with disease), the regular input-output signalling patterns are disrupted, resulting in different, prominent compounds or trends, termed <em>biomarkers</em>. The targeting process itself, from the localised area to the specific cells, requires high sensitivity of the bacterium to the correct area, hence it is these disease specific cellular markers, which the bacteria are genetically programmed to attack. Central to this process is the detection and response of the bacteria to the distinct environmental biomarkers of the disease site - these can be in the form of small bioactive molecules produced by the host cell, such as cytokines and enzymes or alternatively growth factors on receptor cell membranes. Within the bacteria, such detection systems are genetically engineered, often through the manipulation of innate bacterial sensing systems to make them responsive to the desired stimulus - hence attracting the bacteria, and eventually the therapeutic, to its target. Once the therapeutic bacterium interacts with its specific biomarker, an internal signal is sent (within the GM bacterium), indicating the target has been reached and delivery of the therapeutic can occur.</p>\n<p>One such example is the natural <strong>‘two component system’</strong>, that allows bacteria to sense and respond to environmental stimuli. This is composed of two types of proteins: histidine kinases (HKs) on the bacterial cell surface membrane and response regulators (RRs) within the bacterial cell. When a signalling molecule, released by a diseased cell, binds to the HK on the bacterial surface membrane, a process called ‘autophosphorylation’ occurs, whereby a phosphate group is transferred from the HK to the RR protein within the bacterium. This transfer of the chemical information or ‘signal transduction’, activates the RR by causing a conformational change. In turn this enables it to bind to complimentary sites on the DNA of a relevant <em>promoter sequence</em> – a DNA sequence that determines where transcription of a gene begins. Transcription of these specific sites will then occur within the bacterium.</p>\n<p>This process can be modified to suit the context of bacterial drug delivery. Firstly, the HK proteins of the therapeutic bacterium are engineered to sense the specific environment of the disease, achieved via altering their genetic expression so they are specific and complimentary, to the external biomarkers. When the biomarker molecule then binds to the HK protein, this signals that the bacterium has reached the correct location and it is communicated to the bacterial internal RR protein via autophosphorylation. The bacterial RR protein can be similarly genetically modified, so that when binding of the phosphate group occurs, a new conformational change arises. This altered shape will be specific to a different promoter sequence, resulting in the transcription of different genes and hence different outcomes such as bacterial lysis and subsequent release of the therapeutic protein.</p>\n<div class=\"multi-image-row-3\">\n    <div class=\"image\"><div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative;

The basic principle is as follows. Bacteria monitor their population level via the secretion of specific ‘autoinducer’ (AI) molecules – the greater the population density, the greater the concentration of AI secreted. Once the AI concentration reaches a certain level or ‘quorum’, the molecules bind to a transcriptional regulator, which activates the transcription of specific genes.</p>\n<p>In the context of in vivo targeting, if the host cell disease is caused by a bacterial pathogen, the QS device of said pathogen can be integrated with the QS system of therapeutic manufacturing bacteria. In this way the level of AI produced by the therapeutic GM bacteria corresponds to the density of the pathogenic bacteria in the diseased cell, rather than the numbers of GM therapeutic bacteria. The result of this is that the level of autoinducer secreted by the GM therapeutic bacteria is then related to the number of pathogenic bacteria surrounding it. Therefore, as the GM bacteria near the target, the autoinducer concentration increases relative to the severity of pathogenic bacterial infection, triggering the transcription of genes that result in the breakdown of the therapeutic bacterial membrane and allowing the release of the therapeutic compound – a process known as <em>quorum lysis</em>. Additionally, when other sensing systems are in place, quorum lysis can be used without integration of the QS device from the pathogen. This triggers the release of the therapeutic agent when the therapeutic bacterial population increases and is reflected in the concentration of medicinal compound release.</p>\n<div class=\"multi-image-row-3\">\n    <div class=\"image\"><div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative;

Production and delivery of the active drug:</h3>\n<p>Production of the compound occurs throughout the delivery process and is again controlled by genes inserted into the bacteria’s genome that express the desired therapeutic protein – a process known as heterologous expression. In its essence, it entails the introduction of complementary RNA or gene clusters, to the bacterium’s own RNA, such that its cellular machinery expresses this foreign protein. This modification is present inside each of the therapeutic bacteria being used for treatment, such that their population density will therefore affect the level of compound released into the body, making it an important factor to control. In some circumstances the compound synthesised inside the bacterium is already in its active state, needing no additional alteration to its structure. However, in other cases the therapeutic manufactured is only a ‘prodrug’, requiring the further production of an enzyme or protein to convert it into its active, toxic state, once a signal is received that the target site has been reached.</p>\n<p>The second stage of this process is the release of the active compound, which, as discussed, is linked closely to the sensing mechanisms of GM bacteria and the genetic circuits controlling them. Once signals are transmitted that the target site has been reached and infected, certain gene clusters within the therapeutic bacteria are activated that allow for the release of the therapeutic agent (a drug). This can occur in two ways: via direct lysis of the bacterial membrane (as employed in quorum lysis), or through the use of specific transporter proteins that secrete the compound into the diseased cell.</p>\n<h3>3. Termination of treatment:</h3>\n<p>The final stage of this process is the termination of treatment, involving either the death of the GM therapeutic bacteria (via direct lysis or other methods), or by prevention of compound secretion. Most frequently this occurs via the integration of a ‘switch off’ gene in the therapeutic bacterial system, which prevents further compound production. Other routes of termination are also being explored, such as ‘thymineless death’, a phenomenon whereby bacteria cells, when no longer supplied with thymine, undergo cell death. This can be programmed into bacterial strains by deletion of ‘thymidylate’ synthesising gene. However, the direct mechanism for this process is still unknown, reducing its viability.</p>\n<h2>Safety of treatment:</h2>\n<p>Although an effective way to ensure continuous therapeutic production, without the need for repeated injection or reapplication of the drug, there are certain caveats with the process which are still being addressed.  Common to every treatment are side effects that can implicate its safety. With regards to treatments involving genetic modification it is the genetic engineering element itself that often poses the greatest issue. Therefore, when using GM bacteria as in vivo drug factories manufacturers, the engineering of the genome and control of genetic material must be carefully monitored.</p>\n<p>The most prominent risk is that of horizontal gene transfer, which involves the physical movement of genetic material between bacteria - this is in contrast to vertical gene transfer which is the sharing of genetic information between parent and offspring organisms. Horizontal transfer can occur through transformation, (the uptake of free DNA), conjugation (transfer of plasmids between cells) and transduction (transfer of genetic information by a viral vector or ‘bacteriophage’). This sharing of genetic information with bacteria, either in the natural flora of the human body, or in the outside environment can lead to transgene cells, which may have unpredictable interactions with the rest of the body’s microbiota or external organisms. In turn this could lead to unknown, potentially harmful, side effects. Moreover, this type of transfer can induce the spread of antibiotic resistance genes, hence posing a threat to the efficacy of other treatments. However, one scientific method of combat lies in the engineering of GM bacteria without free plasmids, to remove the risk of genetic transfer.</p>\n<div class=\"multi-image-row-2\">\n    <div class=\"image\"><div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 359px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/8fe60b045ac7f02645f7b996365bd81a/1e323/Gene%20transfer.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 55.49999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Horizontal gene transfer\" title=\"Horizontal gene transfer\" src=\"/static/8fe60b045ac7f02645f7b996365bd81a/1e323/Gene%20transfer.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/8fe60b045ac7f02645f7b996365bd81a/e07e9/Gene%20transfer.jpg 200w,\n/static/8fe60b045ac7f02645f7b996365bd81a/1e323/Gene%20transfer.jpg 359w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div></div>\n    <div class=\"image\"><div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 331px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/3542a5e53358ed196cab364873527e22/62452/Bacterial%20transformation.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 57.50000000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Bacterial Transformation\" title=\"Bacterial Transformation\" src=\"/static/3542a5e53358ed196cab364873527e22/62452/Bacterial%20transformation.png\" srcset=\"/static/3542a5e53358ed196cab364873527e22/772e8/Bacterial%20transformation.png 200w,\n/static/3542a5e53358ed196cab364873527e22/62452/Bacterial%20transformation.png 331w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 331px) 100vw, 331px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"centre\"><em>Horizontal gene transfer</em></div>\n<h2>Closing words:</h2>\n<p>To conclude, the use of genetically engineered bacteria as in vivo drug synthesis and delivery vehicles has huge potential for success in the treatment of common diseases, especially given the rising importance of precision medicine and whilst there may still be points of contention surrounding the fine minute control of genetic information, progression in the field of genetic engineering technology, will no doubt enhance the prospects of the technique to target disease in the future.</p>\n<div id=\"bibliography\">\r\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Urquhart, J.

The field involves the designing and redesigning of biological systems to make 'biological machines' that would otherwise not exist in nature. With the futuristic nature of this field, it is no wonder that these technologies have now also made their way into treatments for cancer, a disease with an estimated 19.3 million new cases in 2020 [3].</p>\n<p>One new synthetic approach to treatment as an alternative to bone marrow transplants for blood cancers is CAR-T cell therapy. With bone marrow transplants, patients are given chemo/radiotherapy to weaken their bone structure and destroy unhealthy blood cells, after which they are given bone marrow stem cells from a healthy donor, resulting in the complete replacement of the blood and immune system. This procedure can be lifesaving as a weapon against blood cancers.</p>\n<p>However, there are some disadvantages to bone marrow transplant treatments. Infection is an early danger, and some patients may develop veno-occlusive disease (a severe disease of the liver) due to the radiation. The risk of anaemia and excessive bleeding is increased due to the patient’s lack of red blood cells and platelets, meaning that they will require regular blood transfusions. The ultimate risk is the potential for the recipient's immune system to reject the 'foreign' marrow [4].</p>\n<p>The immune system tells apart normal cells and pathogens and destroys many pathogens effectively. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell with two subtypes that play vital roles in the adaptive immune response; T cells that detect foreign antigens and release toxic chemicals to destroy pathogens, and B cells that produce antibodies that bind to pathogens or foreign substances to neutralise them, as well as recruit other cells to help destroy an infected cell. It is this cell that becomes malignant in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and diffuse large B cell lymphoma.</p>\n<p>Cancer cells caused by mutations in somatic cells have a high chance of being undetected due to being the body’s own tissue. The aim of CAR-T cell therapy is to improve the T cells’ ability to recognise and kill a cancer cell and replicate themselves afterwards. This is made possible by reprogramming the patient’s immune system so that it can recognise the otherwise untraceable specific antigens on the cancer cells.</p>\n<p>After a patient has passed the screening process, millions of the patient's T cells are extracted by an apheresis machine that removes T cells and recycles the blood back into the patient. A computer is then used to model a new written sequence of bases, which are built physically on a DNA printer. The new code programmes the T cells to modify antibodies to fit onto target antigens on the specific cancer. The result of all this re-coding is that the T cells now have chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) attached to them, which bring together the functions of both a T and B cell into a single unit.</p>\n<p>The identification function of the chimaera cell is taken from the variable region of the B cell receptor, and the ability of the chimaera to destroy the cancer is brought from the T cell receptor CD3. However, T cells require more than just the CD3 marker for their attack function; co-stimulatory molecules such as CD28 are needed alongside them so that they can be activated in a way that doesn’t trigger autoimmune responses that would occur if they were activated all the time. The co-stimulatory molecules ensure that the T cells are only activated at specific points in time. Putting these variable regions together on the patient’s T cell leads to the formation of the CAR-T cell; the CD19 B cell markers on the outside of the cell surface membrane connected to the CD28 co-stimulatory molecule and CD3 T cell apparatus on the inside of the cell. The CAR-T cells can now target the otherwise invisible anti-CD19 antigens on cancer cells.</p>\n<p>To introduce this DNA into the patient's T cells, a vector is used that infects the T cell and carries the new and improved DNA with it, such as an inactivated virus. The patient is given a mild dose of chemotherapy to wipe out existing T cells and stop the CAR-T cell response from being dampened. The CAR-T cells are then reinserted into the bloodstream, ready to find and kill cancerous cells.</p>\n<p>Before CAR-T cell therapy, the survival rate of newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients was 38% and the survival rate five years after relapse was 7% [5], whilst diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) had a 2-year survival rate of 20% and a median survival of 6.3 months with salvage therapy [6], showing the unmet need for treatment for both cancers. After the development and use of CAR-T cell therapy as a clinical treatment, a 90% complete remission rate of ALL was recorded [7] and an overall event-free survival of 73% at 6 months and 50% at 12 months [8], as well as DLBCL complete remission rates of 43–58% and a 52% survival rate at a median follow-up of 15.4 months [9], showing the great significance of this breakthrough in blood cancer treatment.</p>\n<p>Whilst CAR-T cell therapy seems to be a promising development that covers previous inadequacies in cancer treatment, a few limitations still exist. One issue is the need for high doses of chemotherapy or radiotherapy to kill malignant cells to ensure the best response to the procedure. This affects healthy tissues in the process and has side effects such as exhaustion, nausea, and vomiting. Another problem is that this treatment is only effective in treating blood malignancies since the CAR-T cells cannot infiltrate the physical barriers or survive within the immunosuppressive environment inside solid tumours. The most challenging limitation of CAR-T cell therapy is the development of tumour resistance to the single target antigen receptor on the newly engineered cell; this is known as antigen escape. While single antigen-targeting CAR-T cells, such as CD19-targeted CAR-T cells, can initially produce high response rates, the cancer cells of a large proportion of patients who receive this treatment exhibit partial to complete loss of target antigen expression. Though 70–90% of relapsed ALL patients respond to CD19 targeted CAR-T cell therapy, eventually resistance arises, with a loss of the CD19 antigen in 30–70% of relapsed patients [10].</p>\n<p>The solution to these problems with CAR-T cell therapy may be given by a different cancer treatment; that is, re-coding bacteria to deliver drugs to solid tumours in the patient. While CAR-T cells need sophisticated engineering to find and infiltrate solid tumours, the inside of solid tumours provides the ideal immunity-deprived microenvironment for bacteria like E. coli, in which they can multiply and grow, then target the tumour from the inside. Besides this, this treatment is much more flexible than other cancer therapies since bacteria do not target a specific cancer type, only the conditions found commonly within cancerous tumours.</p>\n<p>The relevant gene sequences are inserted into the bacteria, much like how they are inserted into CAR-T cells, to give them the ability to synthesise different compounds from what they typically produce; molecules that can inhibit the growth of cancer. In addition, the bacteria can be programmed with various behaviours depending on the presence, absence, or combination of certain conditions using biological circuits. The response does not needlessly impact healthy tissues, unlike chemotherapy and radiation given to patients before bone marrow transplants and CAR-T cell therapy, since the bacteria can identify and target the anaerobic environments and low pH levels that are only characteristic of tumour cells.</p>\n<p>A synchronised lysis circuit (SLC) further enhances the bacteria’s new features. Not only can the bacteria be scheduled to only begin production of anti-cancer drugs within the tumour to avoid the harming of healthy cells, once the drugs have been produced and the bacteria number has reached a certain value, the bacteria undergo apoptosis, allowing the drugs to be released and the bacteria population to decrease to a specific percentage. This remaining portion of bacteria is left to reproduce and regrow the colony to repeat the cycle. The circuit can be reconfigured to set the bacterial lysis timers to whatever schedule will be most effective in destroying the tumour.</p>\n<p>Although this medication is still in its early phases of development, it has already proved successful in eliminating lymphoma tumours in mice, as well as activating the immune system to fight untreated malignant tumours in other regions of the mouse's body.</p>\n<p>Even more recently, the two cell therapies can be merged to form probiotic-guided CAR-T cells (ProCARS), where T cells are genetically engineered to be able to recognise and react to synthetic antigens periodically released by the modified bacteria residing inside the cancerous tumours. Bringing the two treatments together draws the antigen-independence of the bacteria and the sensing abilities of the CAR-T cells together to produce a combined cell therapy solid tumour targeting that can be used for all cancer types [11].</p>\n<p>These new advances in the field of synthetic biology have opened the door to the potential development of individualised and adaptable cancer treatments that go beyond the limitations of singular therapies, all driven by genetically redesigned CAR-T and probiotic bacterial cell research.</p>\n<div id=\"bibliography\">\r\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>[1] Noor, N., Shapira, A., Edri, R., Gal, I., Wertheim, L., Dvir, T., 3D Printing of Personalized Thick and Perfusable Cardiac Patches and Hearts.

India gained independence from British rule in 1947, and since then, the country has undergone significant economic and social changes. One important aspect of these changes has been the impact on economic inequality, which will be discussed in this article.</p>\n<p>Before independence, India was a colony of the British Empire and was subject to several economic policies that contributed to inequality. For example, the British used a system of land revenue that disproportionately benefited large landlords and discriminated against small farmers and implemented policies that favoured certain industries, such as textiles, at the expense of others. The British also imposed high tariffs on Indian goods, which made it difficult for Indian businesses to compete with British products. These policies contributed to a highly unequal distribution of wealth and income in India.</p>\n<p>Since independence, India has implemented several policies and initiatives to address economic inequality and promote economic development. One key policy has been land reform, which has aimed to redistribute land from large landlords to small farmers; this has helped to reduce the concentration of land ownership and increase the income and wealth of small farmers. Other initiatives have included the further development of infrastructure, such as roads, ports, and airports, which has helped to stimulate economic growth and create employment opportunities, especially since most of the income generated remains within the country instead of being sent back to Britain.</p>\n<p>One of the most significant changes in economic inequality in India post-independence has been the overall reduction in poverty. Reports from the World Bank state the percentage of the population living in absolute poverty has fallen from around 60% in the early 1990s to around 21% in 2011. This decrease in poverty can be attributed to a few factors, including economic growth, government programs aimed at reducing poverty and increased access to education and healthcare. One government program that has had a significant impact on poverty in India is the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), introduced in 2006, which provides a legal guarantee of 100 days of paid employment each year to rural households. The program has been successful in providing employment to millions of rural households and has consequently contributed to a reduction in poverty in rural areas.</p>\n<p>However, while poverty has decreased overall, high levels of economic inequality still exist. One factor contributing to this is the persistent disparities in income and wealth between urban and rural areas. Despite efforts to develop rural areas and improve the standard of living in these areas, urban areas continue to have higher incomes and greater access to education and healthcare. For example, surveys from the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) shows that in 2011, the average monthly per capita consumption expenditure (MPCE) in urban areas was Rs 1,109, while in rural areas it was Rs 868. This disparity in consumption expenditure indicates that households in urban areas have higher incomes and greater purchasing power than those in rural areas.</p>\n<p>Another factor contributing to economic inequality in India is the unequal distribution of wealth. Credit Suisse has recently concluded that the top 1% of earners in India account for around 22% of the country's total wealth, while the bottom 60% of earners hold just 4% of the country's wealth. This unequal distribution of wealth has been driven in part by the rapid growth of the country's secondary and tertiary sectors, which has benefited some segments of the population more than others. This effect has been combined with no inheritance taxes resulting in the majority of national wealth accumulating within affluent families over a number of years. The growth of the country's service sector, which accounted for around 60% of India's GDP in 2011, has disproportionately benefited skilled workers with higher levels of education. This has contributed to an increase in income inequality, as skilled workers have seen their incomes rise faster than those of unskilled workers.</p>\n<p>Discrimination based on factors such as caste and gender continue to play a role in economic inequality in India, where lower caste individuals and women are often paid less for the same work as their higher caste and male counterparts and tend to face barriers to education and employment opportunities. Data from the International Labour Organization (ILO) shows that in 2011, the gender pay gap in India was around 27%, due in part to the fact that women are often concentrated in lower-paying occupations and may face discrimination in the labour market.</p>\n<p>One of the more notable contributors of economic inequality is corruption. When public officials engage in corrupt practices, they may direct resources towards projects or individuals that benefit them personally, rather than towards projects or individuals that will have the greatest public benefit. This can result in a misallocation of resources, with some sectors or regions receiving more funding than others and can lead to a further concentration of wealth and income. Whilst the Indian government have recently implemented multiple laws to reduce corruption, such as The Whistleblowers Protection Act (2014) and The Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act (2013), it will take many years before large-scale corruption is eradicated considering how regular enforcement has to be across the entire country.</p>\n<p>Overall, while there have been significant changes in economic inequality in India post-independence, including a reduction in poverty, disparities in income and wealth between urban and rural areas, and an unequal distribution of wealth, continue to persist. Addressing these issues will be critical to ensuring that the country's economic growth benefits all members of society.</p>","frontmatter":{"type":"Article","first_name":null,"surname":null,"school":null,"pronouns":null,"role":null,"slug":"/articles/24","profile_picture":null,"title":"Economic inequality in India","composer":null,"subject":"BFAA34","userID":null,"articleID":"24","userIDs":["aa"],"preview_image":"Inequality.jpg","issue":2}},{"html":"<p>Formula 1 is a truly international sport. The 2023 season is set for a record-breaking 24 races, in 21 different countries, on 6 different continents.

The task, then, of transporting the equipment, cars and personnel to tracks around the world, for nearly half of the weekends in the year presents a massive logistical problem for the teams and for DHL, F1’s official logistics partner.</p>\n<div class=\"image\"><div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 624px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/8dac0c90b8ed7d73919bb0483aea7114/39c09/Redbull.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.49999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Red Bull motion blur shot\" title=\"Red Bull motion blur shot\" src=\"/static/8dac0c90b8ed7d73919bb0483aea7114/39c09/Redbull.png\" srcset=\"/static/8dac0c90b8ed7d73919bb0483aea7114/772e8/Redbull.png 200w,\n/static/8dac0c90b8ed7d73919bb0483aea7114/e17e5/Redbull.png 400w,\n/static/8dac0c90b8ed7d73919bb0483aea7114/39c09/Redbull.png 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div><em></em></div>\n<p>The logistical planning process for each season starts around the same time the official calendar is released, as teams need as much time as possible to ensure they can create back-up plans in case the calendar abruptly changes, such as with the removal of the Russian Grand Prix following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Usually, if the calendar is changed, it is because races are removed, which makes logistics easier, as teams gain an extra week. Due to China’s zero-Covid policy, it has been removed from the 2023 calendar, and various European races are in debate to take Shanghai's spot, which creates a minor problem for the logistics teams. Larger issues, such as 2020’s truncated 17-race calendar brought about in a couple of months, present a much greater problem than adapting to one altered race weekend. The reason behind this is due to the time constraints placed on the teams to adapt to changes, and the sheer amount of equipment and personnel they must transport to every race.</p>\n<p>A race weekend lasts from Friday morning to Sunday afternoon on track, but it starts a few days earlier for the logistics team.  Each team brings 2 cars and a host of spare parts to each race from their base. All but one team are based in Europe, with 5 in England, 2 in Italy, 1 in Austria and 1 in Switzerland. The final team, Haas, are based in North Carolina, but operate a forward base in England. Every part on the car must return to the team’s HQ after every race, for a process known as Non-Destructive Testing (NDT), where they are analysed for safety and performance. This is a fairly easy process when in Europe, but the process creates a few issues when the race takes place outside of Europe. Each part needs to be flown back to base and then to the next race, ready to be assembled and raced from Friday morning.</p>\n<p>The 60-75 strong trackside crew (which varies between teams) consists of a team principal, the drivers, mechanics and pit crew, engineers and personal trainers for the drivers. They usually return home if the journey is short, or stay in the country if they are far from home. Travel is primarily done by truck in Europe, where roughly half of the races are held, as it is far cheaper than flying. Trucks also produce far less emissions than planes, something Formula 1 is conscious about, as part of their Net Zero 2030 plan is to reduce Formula 1’s carbon footprint. “Fly-away” races (those that take place outside of Europe) require planes to make it in time for the next race. While shipping via sea is much cheaper and more environmentally friendly, it is also much slower.</p>\n<p>Teams prepare what are known as “sea kits”, a set of shipping containers that contain non-essential equipment for race weekends, such as kitchen appliances, tables, chairs and some elements of their garages. Five to six sea kits are prepared in January and sent out to the first five or so fly-away races - in 2023 these will be Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Azerbaijan and Miami, unless China is replaced by another fly-away race. When the first race is done, the sea kit is packed up and sent to the next fly-away race - in the case of 2023, Bahrain’s kit will be sent to Canada. This reduces costs and emissions on the non-essential parts of the team’s overall equipment. They could theoretically race without their sea kit’s equipment, though it might be a bit uncomfortable, as they contain some equipment used in their motorhomes.</p>\n<p>Each team uses a motorhome for the race, which in reality are usually multi-storey pop-up buildings - Red Bull’s motorhome is 3 stories tall, except for their special water-borne Monaco motorhome, which is required due to the lack of space in the principality. The alternative would be using a hotel, which is often provided on-site for fly-away races, negating the use of a motorhome for sleeping purposes. However teams still take them as they serve as office space and a place to take some rest, vital for the drivers to ensure they perform as well as possible. These motorhomes are either in the sea kit, or transported by truck from race to race in Europe.\r\nIdeally, the logistics team has 2 weeks to transport all the equipment from race to race. However, 2023 features 6 double-headers and 2 triple-headers, with every race bar one in the second half of the season being part of either a double or a triple header. This places an incredible amount of stress on the team, especially the logistics team. They have from Sunday evening to midday Wednesday to transport all their equipment thousands of miles and set it up, ready for the next race.</p>\n<div class=\"image\"><div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 624px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/18bda91b4a6af33b7569678effab4ec4/39c09/Singapore.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Singapore packing up\" title=\"Singapore packing up\" src=\"/static/18bda91b4a6af33b7569678effab4ec4/39c09/Singapore.png\" srcset=\"/static/18bda91b4a6af33b7569678effab4ec4/772e8/Singapore.png 200w,\n/static/18bda91b4a6af33b7569678effab4ec4/e17e5/Singapore.png 400w,\n/static/18bda91b4a6af33b7569678effab4ec4/39c09/Singapore.png 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div><em></em></div>\n<p>With no time to waste, the teams are packing before the chequered flag has fallen, putting spare parts into trucks, ready to go to the airport - the teams won’t swap an engine or gearbox mid-race. Once the race has ended, the teams really get moving, taking apart the garages, motorhomes and cars, and putting them in trucks. The garage parts, most of the motorhomes and the cars go to the airport, ready to fly to the next race or the team’s base (in the case of the cars), while the non-essential parts are put back into their shipping containers. This is usually achieved within six to eight hours after the race has ended. DHL’s Boeing 747s then fly to the next race by Monday morning - six are required for the equipment of the ten F1 teams. The staff also begin the journey to the next location on Monday too, to give them time to accustom to the new timezone and shake off jet-lag. Timezones can help or hinder the teams - Azerbaijan is 9 hours ahead of Miami, giving the teams an extra 9 hours, while Abu Dhabi is 12 hours behind Las Vegas. By the time the race ends in Las Vegas, it will already be Monday in Abu Dhabi.</p>\n<p>The planes land at the airport, and the cargo is put onto trucks, ready to go to the tracks. The three priority pallets are delivered first - these contain the necessary parts to assemble the garage, which is the first set of equipment to be packed away once the previous race ends. Teams are not allowed access to the track until all the teams priority pallets have been delivered, to ensure fairness. DHL staff handle the pallets instead of the team's crews, delivering them overnight to the track. Once the pallets have been delivered, teams put up the core of their garage on Tuesday, such as the electrical systems and the IT equipment. They then leave the track as the rest of the team’s equipment is brought in, and on Wednesday they complete the garage build, as well as assembling their motorhomes and cars. The garages are operational by noon on Wednesday, despite still being in the air on Monday evening, demonstrating just how quick and efficient Formula 1 teams are off-track. This gives the team a day to rest, ready for the first free practice session on Friday morning.</p>\n<p>Every F1 team, alongside DHL, pulls off this trick every race, almost without fail. Small hiccups sometimes occur, for example, technical issues stalled a plane in 2021, causing Haas to lose out on two days of pre-season testing before the season started. However, 2020 presented a much larger challenge than one grounded plane. In fact, almost every plane around the world was grounded.</p>\n<p>COVID-19 presented a massive problem for the logistics teams in 2020. The pandemic affected the season opener in Australia, resulting in many fans stuck outside of the track with tickets that would no longer let them in to watch the race. The issue quickly grew as the virus spread, causing F1 to draft a new calendar. It was confirmed in June, and it started on the first weekend of July. This gave the teams a singular month to plan for a daunting 17 race calendar. Luckily, the sea kits were sent off in January, and were in place for all the races they were required for. To aid the logistics teams further, 6 races were double headers at the same track - the Austrian and Styrian Grand Prix at the Red Bull Ring, the British and the 70th Anniversary Grand Prix at Silverstone, and the Bahrain and Sakhir Grand Prix at the Bahrain International Circuit. However, the calendar still featured tricky double-headers such as Bahrain to Abu Dhabi and a semi-regional triple-header from Monza to Mugello to Sochi (both Monza and Mugello are in Italy). The lack of planning time meant the teams leaned heavily on their logistics teams to sort out all the issues to deliver racing behind closed doors for the fans at home.</p>\n<div class=\"image\"><div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 624px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/ccca5a7329ca9c8581b52e1a64964bf1/39c09/Race.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.49999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Race shot\" title=\"Race shot\" src=\"/static/ccca5a7329ca9c8581b52e1a64964bf1/39c09/Race.png\" srcset=\"/static/ccca5a7329ca9c8581b52e1a64964bf1/772e8/Race.png 200w,\n/static/ccca5a7329ca9c8581b52e1a64964bf1/e17e5/Race.png 400w,\n/static/ccca5a7329ca9c8581b52e1a64964bf1/39c09/Race.png 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div><em></em></div>\n<p>Overall, the pandemic was managed, though not without complaints from the teams over the lack of time given to adjust to the new calendar.

It is projected that up to 30% of the UK’s citizens could be multiracial by the end of the century - so how can this lead to a multitude of experiences?</p>\n<h2>I. Social Attitudes to Multiracialism</h2>\n<p>To begin with, it is important to outline that multiracial individuals face a very unique form of discrimination, referred to as mixed erasure. This can be thought of as the racial equivalent of bisexual erasure - where the identities of individuals are ignored, removed, falsified or re-explained to fit a separate narrative in primary sources of media. The most extreme forms of this include the belief that multiracial people do not exist. For individuals who have white and non-white ancestry, this can be particularly distressing as their identities are continually debated - ‘you are not a person of colour’ is a common phrase used by surrounding peers. This in combination with labels such as ‘white-passing’, ‘part white’ and comments on ancestral percentages are argued by some to contribute to the monoracial lens of society – where you can only be one or the other. This can become alienating for individuals of white and non-white ancestry; in a world where you are defined by being either white or a person of colour, someone with ancestry in both labels can be made to feel excluded from both groups. As Ela Heeley (Turkish and Romani) put it, “the same equality movement designed to uplift marginalised voices has become the same movement that excludes anyone who doesn’t fit the role of the ‘model minority’.” Categorising people into predetermined boxes based on what they ‘pass’ as disregards parts of their heritage and identity.</p>\n<p>But being mixed is not a recent development - author Heidi Durrow (Danish and African American) pointed out that there is, in fact, a \"long, forgotten history of mixed-race people having achieved great things, but they had to choose one race over the other.” This started to change when Obama (white and Kenyan) began to talk about multiracialism on a mainstream platform – although he campaigned as a Black man, he began to pave the way for more multiracial individuals to feel represented. Despite this, America’s history of the ‘one-drop rule’ helped Durrow realise that there are compelling reasons for mixed-race people with Black ancestry to identify solely as Black. However, she also explains that she is “not interested in mixed-race identity in terms of percentages – I don’t feel like a lesser Dane or a lesser African American. I don’t want to feel like I’m a person made of pieces.” This contrasts the 61% of multiracial individuals in America who, in 2015, did not identify as multiracial at all.</p>\n<p>In order to better understand why the existence of multiracial individuals is so controversial, it would be useful to have a brief outline of the socio-legal positions throughout modern history. The most relevant example is the progression of anti-miscegenation laws, particularly in America, which essentially barred people from different racial backgrounds from marrying; as a result, any children born of an interracial marriage would be illicit.</p>\n<p>The first anti-miscegenation law in America was passed in 1664 under British Colonial rule, and\r\nbanned any marriage between white people and Black people, ordering that any white woman who\r\nmarried a Black man was to become a slave too. Later, these laws extended to include relations\r\nbetween Native Americans and white people. In 1883, the Supreme Court decided unanimously that\r\nstate-level bans on interracial marriage did not violate the 14th Amendment (which says that no\r\nstate can enforce a law that abridges any citizen’s privileges or immunities) - this ruling, decided in\r\nPace v. Alabama, held for more than eighty years. In 1922, the first wave of anti-Asian xenophobic\r\nattitudes began to take hold in law; while previously anti-miscegenation laws had been targeted at\r\nBlack or Native American peoples, the Cable Act of 1922 stripped US citizenship from any white\r\nwoman who married an “alien ineligible for citizenship” - in context of the time, this referred primarily\r\nto Asian people. Progress started to be made to reverse the above laws in 1964, but the Supreme\r\nCourt did not directly address the ban on interracial marriages until the unanimous ruling in the\r\nhistoric Loving v. Virginia case of 1967, which declared that bans on interracial marriage violated the\r\n14th Amendment. After this, interracial marriage became legal throughout the United States, with\r\nAlabama becoming the last state to legalise it in 2000. But to this day, there remains a lot of\r\ncontroversy in the Deep South about interracial marriage, with a 2011 poll showing that many\r\nRepublicans in Mississippi still support anti-miscegenation laws. This notion of racial purity is partly\r\nwhat leads to the exclusion of mixed-race individuals from families and communities. As Black Minds\r\nMatter founder Agnes Mwakatuma rightfully pointed out, mixed people “may not feel that they\r\nbelong to either end of the race spectrum, due to neglect from both parties.” In particular with\r\nfamilies, monoracial parents of multiracial individuals may not understand (and in some cases, refuse\r\nto believe) the experiences of their mixed children, because the discrimination that multiracial people\r\nface is so unique from any other type. This can create alienation and distancing within households,\r\nand young people may feel isolated within their own homes.</p>\n<p>Knowing the history of where terminology came from can help us to unpack why views on interracial\r\nmarriages and multiracial children are so varied and controversial. During the start of the American\r\nCivil War, the term ‘amalgamation’ was used to refer to multiracial individuals, before ‘miscegenation’\r\nappeared in 1863, mostly used by abolitionists who encouraged interracial procreation. This was\r\ninitially published in a hoax pamphlet in order to get Lincoln re-elected, with the promise of solving\r\nAmerica’s ‘race problem’ - the term ‘miscegenation’ outlived Lincoln and changed, with\r\nanti-miscegenation laws becoming the foundational justification for the Jim Crow era of segregation.\r\nRace studies scholar Philip Kadish noted that “the term ‘miscegenation’ has the same prefix as\r\n‘mistake’ and ‘misbegotten’, planting the notion that races represent different species and should be\r\nseparated.”</p>\n<p>But terms are ever-changing. All over the world there have been an array of words used to describe\r\nmultiracial people, from ‘di colore’ (of colour) in early Rome, to ‘hafu’ and ‘daburu’ (half and double\r\nrespectively) in Japan. In 1937, sociologist Everett Stonequist referred to mixed-race people as\r\n“marginal men”. Some multiracial people view the word ‘mixed’ as dehumanising and offensive,\r\npreferring ‘multiracial’. Others view ‘mixed’ as completely normal, and refer to themselves as such.\r\nTerms such as ‘biracial’ are also commonly used, but are too limiting in their nature. The apparent\r\nneed for increased linguistic fluidity is not unusual - activist Andrew Jovilette says that we should\r\n“ask people what they prefer, because we all have different experiences… we shouldn’t create\r\nuniversal truths for everybody, because everybody has different experiences, even if we’re the same\r\nmix.” Differences in experiences are key to understanding and recognising that there is no blanket\r\nterm to cover all multiracial individuals - and nor should there be.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the way we are perceived plays a significant role in shaping multiracial people’s\r\nidentities. Those who are perceived to be white-passing or white-adjacent are treated to be white,\r\nwhich means that yes, we do benefit from white privilege. One potentially positive outcome of this is\r\nthat we can use our position of privilege to raise issues of injustice, and navigate spaces that other\r\nmultiracial individuals may not be able to. This privilege does not disregard the lived experiences of\r\ninjustice and discrimination that we face as mixed people, but it does give us the opportunity to be\r\nable to “come out” with our ancestry and identity, which individuals who are perceived to be people\r\nof colour do not have the option for - they are typecast and stereotyped based on their outward\r\nappearances, just like white-passing people, but face additional prejudices that a white-passing\r\nperson may not.</p>\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum, there also seems to be an odd fascination with the appearance of\r\nmixed-race people. Comments such as “that’s/you’re so hot!”, ”mixed people are always so much\r\nmore attractive”, \"that's/you're so exotic\", “mixed babies are soooo cute!” and “I’d have a baby with a\r\nperson from [xyz ethnic group] so they could look like you” are all examples of fetishisation of\r\nmultiracial individuals - which is not only uncomfortable to be on the receiving end of, but also quite\r\ndisturbing and dehumanising as general statements. On the surface, this appears to convey\r\nacceptance of mixed people, but in actuality it only values mixed people for the outward appearance\r\nand stereotypes us all as immediately attractive only because we're mixed. Exoticisation (a\r\nmanifestation of white supremacy designating something as “other” but nonthreatening) identifies\r\n“familiar” and “foreign” features in mixed people, which further fetishises their so-called “exotic”\r\nfeatures. This, in and of itself, disregards our struggles to fit in a society that assumes monoracialism - it also communicates that mixed-race babies are only born for the purposes of being cute or\r\nattractive. Degrading and disregarding the identities and lives of multiracial individuals, even when\r\nyou think you’re saying something harmless, can have lasting effects on the person being spoken to.</p>\n<h2>II. Impacts on Mental Health</h2>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, all of the above can have a huge impact on the mental health of multiracial\r\nindividuals. Imposter syndrome is a common experience among mixed people, and it goes beyond\r\naffecting our own impressions of knowledge or skills - it affects how we view our own cultural\r\nidentities, and what we feel we are (and subsequently are not) allowed to be. This can create a\r\ndisconnect between the individual and their ancestry, whether in the mind or in practice, and can\r\nmean that multiracial individuals feel like racial imposters, with little or no right to their own cultural\r\nidentities. The fear of accusation of ethnic fishing can cause some multiracial individuals to feel as\r\nthough they ought to prohibit themselves from taking part in cultural events, or wear cultural clothes\r\nand symbols. Cultural appropriation is a very real phenomena, and is rightfully condemned; however,\r\na knock-on effect of this is that multiracial individuals who feel like racial imposters might feel as\r\nthough they have little or no right to their own ancestry and can begin to feel fragmented and\r\nseparated from all of their background - the notion of being “too much” of one and “not enough” of\r\nanother is a common thought process, especially among those who “pass” as one above another and\r\ndon’t speak all of the languages their relatives do.</p>\n<p>There are a multitude of reasons why individuals feel disconnected from their culture and ancestry -\r\nranging from geographical, language and cultural barriers to wider societal issues such as racism and\r\ncolourism. Colourism and a lack of proper representation in the media perpetuates the social isolation\r\nand exclusion that multiracial individuals face - examples include how lighter skin is seen to be more\r\ndesirable among people of colour and mixed people, perpetuating and upholding the ‘proximity to\r\nwhiteness’ standard. In fact, since the 1930s, Brazil has welcomed European immigrants and\r\nencouraged interracial marriage between them and Brazilian citizens, while Chinese and African\r\nimmigrants were barred, in order for the European immigrants, to help “whiten” the population. There\r\nis also a seeming trend to cast monoracial people as canonically multiracial characters - for example,\r\nLana Condor (Vietnamese) was cast as Lara Jean Covey (who is canonically white and Korean) in To\r\nAll The Boys I’ve Loved Before. This works the other way around too - Henry Golding (white and\r\nMalay) was cast as Nick Young (canonically Singaporean Chinese) in Crazy Rich Asians. There are\r\nvery few characters and actors in the media who properly represent multiracial individuals, which can\r\nmean that mixed-race individuals don’t feel heard, or don’t have role models who look like them. This\r\ncan have a significant impact on mental health - from feeling alienated in social settings, and even\r\nsometimes feeling as though we don’t fit into our own skin, with conflicts in our own identities as the\r\nmultiple cultures and ideologies clash.</p>\n<p>Imposter syndrome is not the only mental health effect that societal views and pressures can have on\r\nmultiracial individuals. According to Mental Health America, multiracial individuals are the most likely\r\nto “screen positive or at-risk for alcohol/substance use disorders, anxiety, depression, eating\r\ndisorders, and psychosis”, with a particular trend in susception to depression and anxiety. Even\r\nthough compared to white people in America, mixed-race individuals statistically have higher rates of\r\npoor mental health conditions, there are less protective factors in place for them to seek help. Similar\r\nto how Black people are disproportionately represented in hospitals and prisons compared to white\r\npeople, a December 2021 study carried out by Nuffield Trust in the UK showed that multiracial\r\nindividuals made up around 4% of the restricted patients in hospitals, despite only contributing to\r\naround 2% of the UK’s total population.</p>\n<p>It seems to be a given that certainly some multiracial individuals will suffer from negative mental\r\nhealth conditions as a result of the way society is structured. But it may not be so obvious that\r\ndespite the challenges we face, there have been shown to be some benefits to growing up in a\r\nmulticultural environment. Some of these include, but are not limited to, higher levels of empathy,\r\ntolerance, open-mindedness, creativity and appreciation of others. These could be, in part, due to the\r\nchallenges multiracial individuals have faced. It can also be easier to have more diverse friendship\r\ngroups, finding communities of people both online and offline where the commonality of the\r\n“multiracial experience” brings people together. On top of this, a greater ability to connect with more\r\npeople due to increased cultural experiences/awareness can mean that multiracial individuals can\r\nrelate to their monoracial peers too, on a cultural level, because they may have similar experiences if\r\nthey have taken part in particular festivals, for example.</p>\n<h2>III. Multiracialism and Medicine</h2>\n<p>It has been highlighted recently that there is a significant lack of research into how different\r\nmedicines and health conditions can affect people of colour. There is one particular drug that caused\r\nsome debate - BiDil is a race-based heart medicine, targeted and marketed to improve Black people’s\r\nsymptoms with heart-related issues - so how does this impact multiracial people? Because there is a\r\nlack of widespread understanding on how genetics works, when mixed-race people of Black ancestry\r\nsee medicine marketed at Black people, the first question asked is “How will this affect me?”\r\nConcerns include whether it will only partially work, whether it will work at all, and why it has been\r\nmarketed that way to begin with. This has called into question whether the concept of race is a social\r\nconstruct, or whether there is actually any scientific evidence behind it. An article published on the\r\nNational Library of Medicine in 2006 claims that race is a purely social construct, as the “latest\r\ngenomic science has failed to provide much support for our intuitions about racial categories in\r\nmedicine”, further clarifying that there is no real basis in the genetic coding for race because there can\r\nbe “more genetic diversity within a so-called “racial” cohort than there is difference between two\r\nsuch cohorts”. Despite this, it is noted that eliminating race from medicine would be equally\r\nimpractical, because people of colour are often subject to stressful and traumatic situations due to\r\nthe colour of their skin, which can have an impact on their physical health.</p>\n<p>However, there are some clear examples of how race can impact medicine. In the case of leukaemia\r\npatients of mixed race, it can be especially difficult to reconcile that they may have a significantly\r\nsmaller chance of recovering than monoracial patients, particularly white patients. The treatment\r\ninvolves stem cells being collected from the bone marrow, but there is a catch - the donor and the\r\nrecipient have to be a genetic match. It is more likely that matches are found among strangers of the\r\nsame ancestral background than within families - which means that white people have the highest\r\nchance (77%) of finding a donor because they make up the majority of the donor list. In 2019, only\r\n3% of the world’s donors were mixed race - but even fewer are statistically going to be an exact\r\nmatch to the patient. According to Professor Hermann Einsele, “two different populations” (for\r\nexample, Chinese and Central European) “have different markers (to white donors) which makes\r\nprocedures between different ethnic groups difficult”, especially when the patient has markers\r\nbelonging to more than one population (i.e. they are mixed-race). Due to the lack of donors available,\r\nfamilies of multiracial patients sometimes have no choice but to advertise and campaign for people to\r\noffer to donate - for example, ABC Eyewitness News in 2017 published an advertising article in late\r\n2019 on behalf of the family of a seven-year-old boy who needed a transplant, but could not find a\r\ndonor. Even though the child had been treated using his brother’s bone marrow to begin with, the\r\ncancer returned, which meant that the family had no choice but to look elsewhere for donors.</p>\n<h2>IV. To Conclude</h2>\n<p>In summary, it is fairly self-evident that every single mixed-race person’s experiences are unique -\r\nthere are often points of overlap, perhaps with fetishising comments or imposter syndrome, but the\r\n“multiracial experience” is individual to everyone. This means that the title is perhaps a little\r\nmisleading - there is not one set way to “be mixed” so everybody’s views are going to differ based on\r\ntheir own lived experiences. There is a difference for some people between their ancestry and their\r\nown identities - we are not a monolithic group, and nor should we be treated as such. Even among\r\nsiblings of the same mix, their experiences may differ. While the negative impacts of being\r\nmixed-race can be upsetting to individuals, being mixed is not the issue at hand and it is not\r\ninherently bad for you - it is the views and attitudes of the people and societies around us that cause\r\nus to feel as though we do not belong. The controversy surrounding who we are as people is in itself\r\ncontroversial, when really it shouldn’t be - we are human beings, just like everyone else. With the\r\nrise of multiracialism, we are seeing that the need to label and categorise everything as one or\r\nanother is changing - perhaps this will challenge society’s apparent need for binaries, and allow for\r\ngreater acceptance of fluidity and personal choice in identification in the future.</p>\n<div class=\"right\"><em>AG Upton</em></div>\n<div id=\"bibliography\">\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Oct 2020 - Growing up mixed race in the UK : available at <a href=\"https://www.readersdigest.co.uk/inspire/life/growing-up-mixed-race-in-britain\">https://www.readersdigest.co.uk/inspire/life/growing-up-mixed-race-in-britain</a></li>\n<li>Feb 2021 - Biracial Britain: why mixed-race people must be able to decide their own identity : available at <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/biracial-britain-why-mixed-race-people-must-be-able-to-decide-their-own-identity-154771\">https://theconversation.com/biracial-britain-why-mixed-race-people-must-be-able-to-decide-their-own-identity-154771</a></li>\n<li>Nov 2021 - Mixed-race erasure is a real problem, and it needs to stop : available at <a href=\"https://thebeaverlse.co.uk/mixed-race-erasure-is-a-real-problem-and-it-needs-to-stop/\">https://thebeaverlse.co.uk/mixed-race-erasure-is-a-real-problem-and-it-needs-to-stop/</a></li>\n<li>May 2019 - The Biracial Advantage : available at <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/articles/201905/the-biracial-advantage\">https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/articles/201905/the-biracial-advantage</a></li>\n<li>Aug 2013 - Seven essential facts about multiracial youth : available at <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/pi/families/resources/newsletter/2013/08/multiracial-youth\">https://www.apa.org/pi/families/resources/newsletter/2013/08/multiracial-youth</a></li>\n<li>June 2021 - Interracial Marriage Laws History and Timeline : available at <a href=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/interracial-marriage-laws-721611\">https://www.thoughtco.com/interracial-marriage-laws-721611</a></li>\n<li>Aug 2016 - All Mixed Up: What Do We Call People Of Multiple Backgrounds?

We know for certain that humanity’s unprecedented emission of carbon into the atmosphere has accelerated the greenhouse effect – trapping more heat in the atmosphere – leading to a whole host of serious impacts (including sea level rise, ice melting, more intense weather events and habitat loss). As a result, we are desperately searching for drastic climate change solutions. I would like to suggest that making small alterations to the way we farm will not only improve our resilience but actually act as a carbon sink, becoming a player in reducing atmospheric carbon.</p>\n<p>Agriculture has been named as one of the world’s biggest emitters of carbon, with an estimated 23% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions coming from agriculture, forestry and other land uses. This is a huge portion of our emissions - surprisingly, it is more than all the emissions from transport combined (16.2%). However, taking a step back, it becomes more understandable when considering the number of people who need feeding and thus the vast scale of agriculture. An estimated 30-47% of the world's ice-free land surface is used for agriculture and, since 1961, the total production of cereal crops has increased by 240% up to 2017. In addition to a population boom, the discovery and subsequent use of synthetic fertilisers, a total disregard for the health of farmed land and a sharp rise in meat consumption has caused severe environmental degradation and has been a significant contributor to climate change. The growing practice of intensive farming - the maximum output of food produced in the most efficient way possible - is largely responsible for this.</p>\n<p>The thought of factory farms may spring to mind - feedlots packed with livestock; food brought to their mouths, so they don’t waste energy moving; animals not even seeing a blade of grass before they are slaughtered as early as possible for quick profit, ready for the next batch to move in. This depressing practice is realistic in many parts of the world and completely disregards the environment, although, thankfully, policies which enforce high animal welfare standards and protect the environment prevent this in most developed nations. For example, the EU’s “Farm to Fork” strategy enforces good farming practices, attempting to have a neutral or positive impact on the environment in the production of food.</p>\n<h2>Farming as a climate change mitigator</h2>\n<p>Evidently, a solution is needed to minimise the impact farming has on the environment. While in reality, this involves a vastly complicated and entangled range of factors – for example, not wasting a third of our food worldwide, decreasing meat consumption and reducing the distance our food travels – this article will focus on sustainable farming rather than consumers’ habits. Sustainable farming means food is produced on land in such a way that production can be continued indefinitely. Although the annual yield per unit of land will be lower, as intensive techniques that degrade the soil aren’t employed, in the long term, being able to produce food at a steady yield each year forever (in theory) will enable true food security.</p>\n<h2>Soil</h2>\n<p>Soil is made up of four basic components – minerals, water, air, and organic matter. Minerals are bits of sands, silts and clays which then create pores (or gaps) between each grain of material, where water and air can reside. Organic matter, often referred to as humus, is any organic material that is within the soil and is the main source of microbial activity. As long as soil is moist, airy and rich in organic matter, it will be thriving with microorganisms which decompose organic matter to release energy. Such healthy soil is able to trap carbon dioxide, as it binds to minerals, meaning it plays a significant role in the climate crisis. Furthermore, organic matter on its own is sequestering carbon as, on average, 50-58% of organic matter is carbon. Considering how much soil covers the Earth’s surface and given that such a large portion of land is used for farming, it seems obvious that it must be managed to increase the amount of carbon stored in this sink.</p>\n<p>When soil has a very active population of microorganisms, the cycle of nutrients within the soil is greatened, thus better supporting crop growth. There is a mutual relationship between soil organisms and plants, as roots deposit large amounts of carbon into the soil to nourish microorganisms. In return, microbes carry out nitrogen fixation and nutrient mineralisation – putting molecules into forms that roots can absorb by diffusion – accelerating the growth of the plant. Modern-day farming uses synthetic fertilisers to do this instead, with mineralised nutrients (that have been produced off site) being directly applied. However, these chemicals have a negative impact, reducing soil activity. This is demonstrated by the decreased activity of nematodes after the application of synthetic fertiliser - a good indicator as the nematode family is one of the biggest populations of organisms found in the rhizosphere (the soil around plant roots), which is arguably the most important region of soil for organism activity.</p>\n<p>To many people this might beg the question, “Why does it matter if fertilisers are reducing soil life when they are so good at producing more food?”. The answer lies within how sustainable synthetic fertilisers are to produce and use. The Haber Process, which is the technique used in the manufacturing processes of the most common fertilisers, uses hydrogen extracted from natural gas, depleting reserves. It also emits large quantities of greenhouse gases through the high energy demand of producing the high temperature and pressure needed for the reaction and the transportation to farms. Furthermore, as already discussed, applying a fertiliser to soils reduces the activity and diversity of the organisms within the soil. This has a knock on effect on the nutrient recycling capabilities of the soil, therefore providing fewer nutrients to the dependent plants but also reducing the carbon sequestration effect of the soil. This, along with tillage (disruption of the soil using machinery), is what is causing soil degradation and resulting in carbon being released into the atmosphere from its store in the soil.</p>\n<p>Farming sustainably is therefore centred around the health of the soil.</p>\n<h2>Steps to make farming sustainable</h2>\n<p>So far, the use of livestock has had little mention. However, they play an instrumental role in an ideal sustainable farming operation. The use of forage (most often this is grass) and livestock (usually cattle) is one of the best ways of restoring soil ecosystems and drawing down atmospheric carbon. This works as forage absorbs carbon dioxide from the air and is then digested to be mostly returned to the ground as a manure which builds up the humus of the soil. This supports the growth of biodiversity in the soil, which in turn helps to cycle nutrients faster. Furthermore, with a regenerative grazing scheme, it is low input – it requires no fertiliser as that is effectively being done by the manure and no intensive operations like tillage or ploughing are needed to disrupt the carefully constructed ecology and structure of the soil. This is a win-win scenario where the farmer has to do little to manage the land and yet gets rewarded by a healthy soil and some meat produce.</p>\n<p>The concept outlined above is called ‘agro-ecology’ which is described as applying ecological principles to an agricultural setting. The use of livestock can work within crop rotation: instead of continuously growing monocultures of cereal crops every year in the same field (which causes degradation of soil and biodiversity), fields can be given ‘recovery periods’ where forage crops can be sown and herds of cattle can intensively graze small sections of the field before being moved on. The effects of this are a build up of organic matter and a regeneration of the soil ecosystem so that when a cash crop is planted the next year, it has a soil full of decomposers and nutrients to support strong growth of the crop. This also comes with additional benefits of greater moisture retention and a better symbiosis between the plants and rhizosphere, aiding the growth of the plant and its resilience to events such as drought.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this is rarely considered throughout the world, likely due to a complicated range of factors including local climate, economics, cultures and education. It may be considered a poor use of land as it puts areas out of intense productivity for extended periods of time and farmers don’t think they can afford to lose productive land. This is especially the case when crops are being damaged and lost from natural hazards (which are becoming more frequent and severe) or when governments fail to recognise the benefits of ecology in a farming background and don’t provide financial incentives. A positive feedback loop is therefore created, where there is a rush to produce more food in an unsustainable way, due to the pressure from increasing demand, resulting in the environment and climate taking a hit. This creates a further pressure for food, causing a spiral.</p>\n<p>In the UK, we have the Environmental Stewardship Scheme where farmers get paid per hectare to manage land in an environmentally friendly way and there are certain criteria that farmland has to meet depending on the level of scheme that farmers have applied for. This aims to make it worthwhile for farmers to prioritise the environment on their land, as they can afford a decrease in productivity if the government provides compensation. This is a great example of environmentally friendly farming systems finally being given the attention they deserve and being recognised as an effective way to rejuvenate degraded land, increase carbon sinks and protect food security.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>With agriculture being both fundamental in supporting the human population and a key player in the climate crisis, it must be viewed by governments and the public not as an enemy to climate change but as an essential tool to mitigate it. In order to sustainably utilise land for farming, we need to understand that the health of the soil is paramount and that allowing it to recover is far more important than attempting to farm it intensively until it becomes too degraded to use. It is unfair on farmers to blame them for their actions when they are simply trying to meet the demand for food and earn a living. Instead, shedding light on this issue and creating more awareness will lead to more governments making significant changes to agricultural policies, having a far more widespread and positive effect.</p>\n<div id=\"bibliography\">\r\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\n<p>DeGomez, T., Kolb, P. and Kleinman, S.

Supposedly fated by the heavens whilst in Lady Feng’s womb, Yuan Shu was youngest son of the <em>Minister of Works</em> Yuan Feng. By the time of Yuan Shu’s birth, the Yuan Clan of Runan had become one of the most powerful families in Eastern Han China, following their <em>Four Generations of Three Grand Excellences</em>, when both his uncle and father served at the court of Emperor Zhang. However, fortunes had seemingly been bestowed onto the second born son, Yuan Ji, since the eldest, Yuan Shao, was born from a maid and considered unworthy. Yuan Ji was raised strictly and expected to inherit Yuan Feng’s titles. As a result; the young Yuan Shu was free to do as he wished when he was younger and spent most of his time hunting with other young masters using companions of eagles and dogs— like some kind of Disney prince.</p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n    <div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 536px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/d2862daa9de03838a39003157a4a70ec/2d920/Yuan%20family%20tree.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 43.99999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Yuan family tree\" title=\"Yuan family tree\" src=\"/static/d2862daa9de03838a39003157a4a70ec/2d920/Yuan%20family%20tree.png\" srcset=\"/static/d2862daa9de03838a39003157a4a70ec/772e8/Yuan%20family%20tree.png 200w,\n/static/d2862daa9de03838a39003157a4a70ec/e17e5/Yuan%20family%20tree.png 400w,\n/static/d2862daa9de03838a39003157a4a70ec/2d920/Yuan%20family%20tree.png 536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div>\n    <em>Yuan family tree</em>\n</div>\n<p>However, as he grew older his ambition drove him to a more scholarly life in order to pursue a political career. He even forgoed  time at the hunting grounds to spend longer hours at home in order to embody the filial piety of the Han, a necessity of character in order to receive a recommendation letter for Government positions. Given the illustrious record and prestige of his family the recommendation letter did come and, with almost prophetic coincidence and immense privilege, Yuan Shu graduated from the local government as the Administrator of Henan - the exact title that the great Yuan An, founder of the Yuan clan, had held for 10 years. Yuan Shu then quickly received the title Colonel of the Rapid Tiger Guards, a retinue of light cavalry that guarded the imperial palace from external and internal threats. The Tiger Guards were also one of the only cavalry units in the capital, Luoyang; this in combination with his family's name made Yuan Shu an attractive ally for those at Emperor Liu Hong’s court.</p>\n<h2>The Ten Attendants and He Jin</h2>\n<p>In the later years of Liu Hong’s reign tension had been boiling between the eunuch faction and Grand General He Jin. Declared Emperor as a child, Liu Hong was raised by the eunuchs and became close to a eunuch named Zhang Rang in particular. Named The Ten Attendants, the eunuch faction began to increase its power in court through its close ties to the Emperor. In 188, the eunuchs even obtained their own militia when one of their faction members, Jian Shuo, was appointed as a colonel of the Army of the Western Garden. The original purpose of the Army of the Western Garden was to prevent He Jin from securing all the military power in Luoyang. Of course this worked effectively until Liu Hong’s sudden death in the winter of 189. His death was so sudden that Liu Hong had not formally named a successor between his two sons. Empress He and He Jin both supported the elder brother, Liu Bian, in the succession as it followed tradition. On the contrary, The Ten Attendants supported the younger brother Liu Xie since he would be easier to exploit in the manner that they did with his father. Between the Jian Shuo’s eunuch faction and He Jin, Yuan Shu picked He Jin for a variety of reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firstly, as a member of the social elite, Yuan Shu believed that the eunuchs were subhuman and an unnatural blemish on the Han Dynasty.</li>\n<li>Secondly, siding with Empress He could play to his advantage in the future as it could help him gain enough favour in the Imperial Court for another promotion.</li>\n<li>Thirdly, He Jin held many military connections and had a similar career path whom the young Yuan Shu could potentially learn a lot from.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For these reasons it made sense for Yuan Shu to naturally commit to He Jin’s cause who had also attracted the talents of eldest brother Yuan Shao. Despite being in favour of Liu Xie,  the eunuchs had no conventional standing as officials in court which meant an even greater lack of voice on matters of succession. Under these circumstances, they decided on a more blunt force strategy and began to plot the assassination of Liu Bian which also meant the assassination of his protector, He Jin. The story, which ought to be told in detail, then goes that Jian Shuo forged a letter to Empress He, asking for He Jin’s assistance and presence at the palace at which point he would be murdered. Unfortunately, Jian Shuo was intercepted by an old servant of He Jin, who fled the capital. Once safe, He Jin arrested and executed Jian Shuo. He Jin then secured all the military power available by absorbing Yuan Shao’s, another Colonel of the Army of the Western Garden, forces. Thus the Army of the Western Garden had dissolved and no one in Luoyang could contest He Jin, leading to Liu Bian taking the throne.</p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n    <div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 550px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/1fed66cd1343281cf1ef79280d19e32c/dd45a/The%20Ten%20Attendants.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 79.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAQCAYAAAAWGF8bAAAACXBIWXMAAA7DAAAOwwHHb6hkAAAC8klEQVQ4y3VUx0pkQRQt/AM34lb3LvwDXQjqwoV+gC4c8QdcuDKjqMg0BjAg5jADRszaxm4TdhtQug0obY6YxXiGc2be0MrMheJV1au699xzzy2DP3Z3d4eXlxfNPz4+NKz5+/v7pz2u/c36x2Fub2/x+vqK1NRUTE1N/T3g//U3y9nl5SWKiopwf3//6azZ3d3F2toaJicnsb6+Dq6Pj48VhPb8/IyTkxO8vb3h7OxMe1dXV1hcXER+fj5ubm4+ITUDAwPo6urC6ekpVlZW4Ha74fV4sbW1JadPT0+IiYnB4OAgcnNzcXBwgOTkZJSUlMDlcsHn88lZdna2EBsim56exuHhIVK+paC8vBx7e3vweDxyzoCVlZWYm5vTmJ+fR21tLUZHRzE2Nob4+Hjttbe3Y2JiAub8/Fx8MJ2Ojg79aGhowOrqqpwFBgYiLy9P+wwyNDSEiooKOSPn1dXVOud0OEWV2dnZkUPyR2S8SARMPzY2FkFBQYiMjER6ejrsdjuWl5eFyOFwaE2HnZ2dypC0mJmZGUVmlLi4OCQmJqK/v197ISEhCA8PR0FBAaKjo4WKgXlnYWFBFBB9XV0djo6O9DXDw8NKo7u7G2FhYUhKSsK+bx8bGxsIDQ1FVFSUClFYWIimpiZRwcsXFxeYnZ1FVVUVvF4vnE4nMjIyYB4eHiSb6+trEc2K0xISEhAQEKAAlA7lkZOTg5qaGgUjPdvb2yoYU9/c3FRxDVPo6emRQ0Yn0XQaERGB4OBgcWR1Emmpr69HX18fmpubYftuU0MUFxeLorKyMhguyM3j4yNYILYf0TA9Ihq3j2NpaUm6IzVUBY1p2mw2FTEzM1NOGxsbYdra2uSAfBAtuaFY6Zg6JOKfP34q2P+MKmHVR0ZGfsuGC8qCHLpdbumQbUQE1Jx/H/s/BNbaMr4LQshLrGJWVhbS0tLQ0tKiA0yjtbVV868v0ddhPRqGqRJRb2+vOqW0tFSc0ihutuZXdP96iazn6xdRniqLua6NvgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"The Ten Attendants\" title=\"The Ten Attendants\" src=\"/static/1fed66cd1343281cf1ef79280d19e32c/dd45a/The%20Ten%20Attendants.png\" srcset=\"/static/1fed66cd1343281cf1ef79280d19e32c/772e8/The%20Ten%20Attendants.png 200w,\n/static/1fed66cd1343281cf1ef79280d19e32c/e17e5/The%20Ten%20Attendants.png 400w,\n/static/1fed66cd1343281cf1ef79280d19e32c/dd45a/The%20Ten%20Attendants.png 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div>\n    <em>The Ten Attendants</em>\n</div>\n<p>New opposition to the He clan would take form in Empress Dowager Dong and her nephew, Dong Chong who accused the Hes of using the death of Emperor Liu Hong as an opportunity to purge the government in a power grab and using the new Emperor, Liu Bian, as a puppet. The two empresses argued for nights until Empress Dowager Dong shouted:</p>\n<div class=\"centre\"><em>“You are powerful now because you rely on your brother! But I can order the General of Agile Cavalry to cut off He Jin's head, and that would be as easy as turning my hand!”</em></div>\n<p>Less than two weeks later, on the 11th June 189, Dong Zhong was arrested and imprisoned. Knowing that the prospect of freedom would require copious amounts of opium to event speak of, Dong Zhong committed suicide. Empress He wrote an imperial decree to banish Empress Dong to Hejian where her condition deteriorated after hearing of Dong Zhong’s death and she died shortly after in the same year. This would have arguably been a political victory for Empress He and He Jin except that both Dong Zhong and Empress Dowager Dong were adored by the public, leading to a drastic fall in the popularity of the He clan. Regardless, they still had a monopoly on violence and the public were unable to take action and things calmed down after a while.</p>\n<p>As Yuan Shao left Luoyang to pursue his own ambitions he placed Zhang Jin in his stead. Upon arrival Zhang Jin noted that the whole capital was blatantly corrupt and he notified He Jin who determined the source of the corruption to be the eunuchs. And thus the plan came about to exterminate The Ten Attendants and funnily enough Yuan Shao came back when he heard about the plan. Empress He wasn’t convinced that such a measure would be necessary so the three considered bringing the tyrannical and feared Dong Zhuo to the capital in order to “convince” Empress He of the necessity to kill the eunuchs. Wary and fearful of the new anti-eunuch influence in the capital, the eunuchs tried to summon He Jin at the palace. Yuan Shao advised that the eunuchs ought to be killed as opposed to entering the palace. Wary of his unpopularity and the threat of rebellion, He Jin decided against and instead ordered Yuan Shao to lead an investigation on the claims against the eunuchs. Yuan Shu was then ordered by Yuan Shao to replace the palace guards who showed more loyalty to the eunuch faction than He Jin. Only once all of the following was accomplished would Empress He write an imperial decree calling for the eunuchs to be dispatched. Very cool but Zhang Rang overheard all of this so the eunuchs forged a letter to He Jin from the Empress, requesting his presence in the palace. Upon entering the palace He Jin was murdered and, not knowing that the Yuan brother’s were outside with every soldier and officer in Luoyang, the eunuchs threw his head over the wall in a final act of disrespect. Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu then stormed and set fire to the capital, killing any man without facial hair. Young men dropped their pants in order to prevent being killed and over 2000 eunuchs were killed, irrespective of their ties to The Ten Attendants. In the chaos, eunuch Duan Gui kidnapped Liu Bian and Liu Xie and fled the capital when he ran into Dong Zhuo’s army who took captive the brothers. The significance that this event plays in the development of the Yuan brother’s cannot be understated. They were both still very young and, despite being in positions of power and responsibility, held no real decision making power in neither their clan nor the imperial government. However, after Emperor Liu Hong and He Jin’s deaths, the two became prominent players in the politics of Eastern Han since they inherited He Jin’s monopoly on violence. This was hugely important as Yuan Shu stayed ambitious until his death. Upon Dong Zhou’s power grab, Yuan Shu was offered a promotion to General of the Rear. Yuan Shu rejected this offer and fled this capital to Nanyang, probably due to Dong Zhuo’s poisoning of Emperor Liu Bian and Empress He, making him deeply unpopular in gentry clans.</p>\n<h2>In Fair Nanyang</h2>\n<p>Acting on this distaste for Dong Zhuo, the new imperial “protector”, Yuan Shu joined the Coalition of the East Pass which was headed by Yuan Shao who was no longer just the son of a maid since he was adopted their uncle, Yuan Cheng. This infuriated Yuan Shu, who’s mother was now held in higher regard than a concubine of Yuan Feng. Upon Yuan Cheng’s death, Yuan Shao inherited the title of Second Marquis and became the head of a branch of the family. In contrast Yuan Shu was left with just being the second born son as Yuan Ji inherited all of Yuan Feng’s titles. However, Yuan Shu was blessed with the merits of the men by his side, namely Sun Jian. Although strange at first glance, at this point Sun Jian held the title of Administrator of Changsha after serving years in the military. He was the third born son of a melon farmer and if his sons, Sun Quan and Sun Ce, had not found the Kingdom of Wu then Sun Jian’s legacy would have been limited to just being a general of Yuan Shu, who had a terrible military record. Sun Jian’s first task under Yuan Shu would be to kill Zhang Zi, the Administrator of Nanyang and a Dong Zhuo loyalist. Sun Jian tricked Zhang Zi into attending a dinner at his military encampment before detaining him as a hostage. Zhang Zi was then framed for crimes and punished with execution; the whole thing was a masterful operation. Thus, Yuan Shu seized control Nanyang and made it his main cantonment; this was a huge step in feeding Yuan Shu the ambition he had since Nanyang was one of the most populated commanderies but, perhaps more importantly, it was also spared from the Yellow Turban Rebellion which made it substantially wealthier than it would have otherwise been. Yuan Shu also named Sun Jian as the General Who Breaks the Enemy and Prefect of the Yu Province in recognition of his merits. It is important to note that Yuan Shu had effectively no authority in Dong Zhuo’s court to grant these titles but that was okay, since if the Coalition of the East won over Dong Zhuo, he could easily grant both.</p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n    <div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 360px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/4da6c54b087b275565857d278feceb64/f21e7/Sun%20Jian.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 133.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Qing Dynasty illustration of Sun Jian\" title=\"Qing Dynasty illustration of Sun Jian\" src=\"/static/4da6c54b087b275565857d278feceb64/f21e7/Sun%20Jian.png\" srcset=\"/static/4da6c54b087b275565857d278feceb64/772e8/Sun%20Jian.png 200w,\n/static/4da6c54b087b275565857d278feceb64/f21e7/Sun%20Jian.png 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div>\n    <em>Qing Dynasty illustration of Sun Jian</em>\n</div>\n<p>In response to the power grab, Dong Zhuo sent Hu Zhen to deal with Yuan Shu’s dissenter faction at Ruyang, Nanyang. Hu Zhen expected little resistance and arrived seeing Sun Jian’s farewell feast for his logistics officer which was held outside the encampment. As Sun Jian watched the horizon slowly fill out with ranks of soldiers he calmly continued the banquet and asked his officers to slowly filter back to camp and prepare men. Seeing this strange display of composure, Hu Zhen hesitated and stalled, losing the opportunity to attack the now prepared camp. The “Battle of Ruyang” ended as Hu Zhen retreated, with no way of fulfilling his body quota. Following subsequent military ventures, Sun Jian gained fame across China and was even offered a political marriage and a blank cheque for any government post by Dong Zhuo. Not the biggest fan of the big guy, Sun Jian resumed his march and headed for the now abandoned capital, Luoyang. However, jealous of Sun Jian’s fame and popularity, Yuan Shu decided to cut off Sun Jian’s supplies to prevent him from seizing even more military glory. It is important to note that although Luoyang was burnt down during the massacre, it still held a vast amount of prestige and possession of the capital was still highly coveted by regional warlords at this time. Sun Jian was forced to convince Yuan Shu of his continued loyalty and the need for his support in order to retake Luoyang from Lu Bu. The Coalition of the East Pass finally had a material achievement in their rebellion against Dong Zhuo’s centralised government; however, it was all too little too late and the coalition was already torn apart by the warlords’ own regional interests. No longer interested in taking down Dong Zhuo, the coalition was over by the end of 191. Even worse, Sun Jian also recovered an imperial jade seal from Luoyang. Not letting this object of legitimacy slip by, Yuan Shu held Sun Jian’s lady hostage and demanded the seal which Sun Jian turned over.</p>\n<h2>One Step Forward… Two Steps Back</h2>\n<p>Yuan Shu now had two things to support his legitimacy as an Emperor: control of the capital, and an imperial seal; which also carried the Mandate of Heaven. It was around this time that Yuan Shu seriously started considering his dream of the Zhong-Shi Dynasty; however, the actual Han Dynasty Emperor Liu Xie was still alive (Dong Zhuo decided to kill off the older Liu Bian in similar logic to the eunuchs) and soon things would go slightly pear shaped. Although Nanyang was a wealthy commandery, Yuan Shu was left in an incredibly precarious position given the tattered state of the coalition. To the east lay the powerful Gentleman of the Han, Liu Biao, and to the west the cunning Cao Cao. Luckily for him Yuan Shao was buried away in the northern most parts of China, far away enough so that the two would struggle to maintain supply lines in a war. Regardless, the very ground that Yuan Shu stood on was subject to siege at any given moment and, knowing this, he acted fast. He allied with Yuan Shao’s northern rival, Gongsun Zan, and in response Yuan Shao allied with Liu Biao: the rivalry between the two siblings had never and could not have been worse. In an effort to diminish Yuan Shao’s influence, Yuan Shu sent Sun Jian to Xiangyang with orders to attack Liu Biao.</p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n    <div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 602px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/7159485f667e05c32b161d90132f85f9/32056/Battle%20of%20Xiangyang.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 81.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Qing Dynasty illustration of the Battle of Xiangyang, Sun Jian's forces are on the left and Liu Biao's are on the right\" title=\"Qing Dynasty illustration of the Battle of Xiangyang, Sun Jian's forces are on the left and Liu Biao's are on the right\" src=\"/static/7159485f667e05c32b161d90132f85f9/32056/Battle%20of%20Xiangyang.png\" srcset=\"/static/7159485f667e05c32b161d90132f85f9/772e8/Battle%20of%20Xiangyang.png 200w,\n/static/7159485f667e05c32b161d90132f85f9/e17e5/Battle%20of%20Xiangyang.png 400w,\n/static/7159485f667e05c32b161d90132f85f9/32056/Battle%20of%20Xiangyang.png 602w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div>\n    <em>Qing Dynasty illustration of the Battle of Xiangyang, Sun Jian's forces are on the left and Liu Biao's are on the right</em>\n</div>\n<p>In the initial skirmish, Sun Jian faced off against Liu Biao’s general, Huang Zu, and came out on top before surrounding the city and preparing siege weapons. Liu Biao sent Huang Zu out again, this time to muster reinforcements from the south. However, on his return journey Sun Jian led a charge against the forces and routed Huang Zu’s forces, once again, who took refuge in the mountains. Riding the momentum and hoping to destroy Liu Biao’s ability to defend the settlement, Sun Jian pursued Huang Zu’s forces into the forested mountains where he was ambushed and cut down by a hail of arrows. With Sun Jian dead, Yuan Shu was beaten by Liu Biao whose forces quickly managed to cut off all supply lines into Nanyang. When studying Yuan Shu’s policies it is important to look into his character. Here was a man who was deeply envious of others; ambitious; cruel; and decadent. Under Yuan Shu, the once prosperous Nanyang was plundered poor and drained so dry that by the time it came under siege from Liu Biao’s forces there were no reserves left. Thus, abandoned Nanyang and fled eastwards where he would look to expand into Cao Cao’s territory in the Yan Province. In 192, Yuan Shu turned a blind eye to past alliances and joined forces with the central government, now run by Li Jue after the assassination of Dong Zhuo, whilst marching towards the Cao Cao’s encampments. The force also consisted of some Southern Xiongnu tribes and Blackmountain Bandits. Upon arrival in Yan Province, Yuan Shu sent one of his generals to make a forward camp. However, before the camp could be finished Cao Cao crushed the general’s forces with about 30000 men. Yuan Shu ordered the combined forces to march on Cao Cao but was defeated as many of the bandits and tribesmen fled when it was apparent that the prospects of victory were slim at best.</p>\n<p>In the next three months Yuan Shu suffered repeated defeats and retreated roughly 700km as Cao Cao pursued him through Fengqiu, Xiangyu, Taishou, and Ningling before allowing Yuan Shu to settle in Jiujiang. Yuan Shu was ultimately saved by Cao Cao’s urgency in another conflict with Tao Qian as the latter was accused of ordering the murder of Cao Cao’s father. Disgraced and demoralised, Yuan Shu gave up the idea of fighting back, decided to just restart his efforts where he was and, similarly to how he took control of Nanyang, launched a surprise attack on the Prefect of the Yang Province, Chen Wen. Yuan Shu then named himself as the new Prefect of the Yang Province as well as Marquis of Xu Zhou and Duke of Yang Zhai. Funnily enough Li Jue didn’t mind this and confirmed Yuan Shu as Prefect of the Yang Province. The southern part of the Yang Province was largely in rebellion and a semi autonomous region where the central government’s influence was severely limited; nonetheless, it gave Yuan Shu the whiff of legitimacy he so desperately needed to fuel the flames of ambition and to continue with his pursuit of establishing his dynasty. With the official mandate of residence: he cemented his grip in the north of the province and even managed to claim a bit of Tao Qian’s land since Cao Cao was winning the war handedly.</p>\n<h2>Yuan and Yang</h2>\n<p>The Yang province had a few commanderies which would be key to Yuan Shu’s hegemony over the area. Of course his influence was initially concentrated in the place of his arrival, Jiu Jiang, but he would need to reign in the whole region to support his claims of legitimacy. Lu Jiang was governed by the senior statesman Lu Kang who had deep ties within the south. Lu Kang did not recognise Lu Jie’s or Yuan Shu’s court as legitimate and disregarded Yuan Shu’s commands as Prefect. In Yu Zhang Liu Biao had appointed an administrator to compete with the central government’s assigned administrator as an attempt to take control of the commandery. Neither side had reasonable control of the commandery which was effectively run by bandits and the gentry. Dan Yang and Wu were both brought into the fold by Yuan family ties to the Sun and Wu clan. Sun Jian’s brother in law, Wu Jin, was the Administrator of Dan Yang and an old lieutenant of Sun Jian, Zhu Zhi, became the Administrator of Wu. Unfortunately, Yuan Shu’s influence was stretched thin in the southern commandery of Kuai Ji which was run by Wang Lang, a famous scholar who also disregarded both Li Jue and Yuan Shu’s claims over the region. Despite political opposition to the west and from the south, neither Lu Kang or Wang Lang decided to attack and dislodge Yuan Shu from the region.</p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n    <div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 602px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/ac08c731d73ed89ddb2e3b9891617ba6/32056/Yang%20Province.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 80%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Map of the Yang Province, the Yangtze runs through the Southern border of Lu Jiang, Jiu Jiang, and Guang Ling\" title=\"Map of the Yang Province, the Yangtze runs through the Southern border of Lu Jiang, Jiu Jiang, and Guang Ling\" src=\"/static/ac08c731d73ed89ddb2e3b9891617ba6/32056/Yang%20Province.png\" srcset=\"/static/ac08c731d73ed89ddb2e3b9891617ba6/772e8/Yang%20Province.png 200w,\n/static/ac08c731d73ed89ddb2e3b9891617ba6/e17e5/Yang%20Province.png 400w,\n/static/ac08c731d73ed89ddb2e3b9891617ba6/32056/Yang%20Province.png 602w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div>\n    <em>Map of the Yang Province, the Yangtze runs through the Southern border of Lu Jiang, Jiu Jiang, and Guang Ling</em>\n</div>\n<p>Thus, Yuan Shu was able to rest and recoup his strength. In 194 he also acquired the services of Sun Jian’s son, Sun Ce. It is common belief that Yuan Shu did not treat the Sun clan as generously as he could have, namely Sun Ce by citing Yuan Shu reneging on his promise to appoint Sun Ce as Administrator of Jiu Jiang following their war with Liu Bei. The position was ultimately awarded to a man named Chen Ji. However, there are arguments that can be made for Yuan Shu not granting the title. Firstly, Sun Ce was barely 19 at the time and had little to no experience in war or statesmanship; thus, it would not have been strange to see Sun Ce perform inefficiently and ineffectively in his new role. Secondly, granting Sun Ce such a high ranking title based only on his lineage would have certainly upset other courtiers and weakened Yuan Shu’s claims to legitimacy. Thirdly, the Sun clan already held an arguably absurd amount of influence within the Yuan Shu’s court which would have endangered them should Yuan Shu hold suspicions. Just to quickly address the Sun clan’s influence in the region:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Administrator of Dan Yang, Wu Jing, was Sun Ce’s uncle</li>\n<li>Administrator of Wu, Zhu Zhi, was one of Sun Jian’s officers</li>\n<li>Administrator of Guang Ling, Sun Ben, was also one of Sun Jian’s officers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Evidently a large amount of the land was run by the Sun clan, if Yuan Shu appointed Sun Ce as the Administrator of Jiu Jiang, he would effectively be giving over ownership of his commanderies to Sun Ce who was the de facto head of the Sun clan.</p>\n<p>Just as commonly cited is Yuan Shu’s promise to award Sun Ce with the position of Administrator of Lu Jiang, if he could assist Yuan Shu in removing Lu Kang who refused to supply Yuan Shu’s army during their war with Liu Bei. Of course, the 70 year old Lu Kang had no obligation to assist Yuan Shu in an offensive war against another governor but Yuan Shu didn’t take rejection well and tasked Sun Ce with Lu Kang’s dispatch in hopes of similar successes that Sun Jian brought him in the murder of Zhang Zi. To Yuan Shu’s disappointment, Sun Ce took two years to capture the settlement. Not quite the performance that Sun Jian’s son could be expected of and thus the title of administrator was never offered. The little conqueror quickly made up for himself as, handed only 1000 men and a few horses, he destroyed the forces of Liu Yao to regain control of Dan Yang; strengthened Yuan Shu’s influence in the south by beating Wang Lang in Kuai Ji; and forced many of the dissenting factions (both government forces and bandits) into Yu Zhang. By 197, Yuan Shu’s territory now consisted of all commanderies of the Yang province as well as the Guang Ling province.</p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n    <div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 450px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/3f5670c93192da18af913f739657f205/fc2a6/Central%20and%20Eastern%20Han.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 111.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Division of Central and Eastern Han by 197, Yuan Shu is uncontested and has the largest area of influence.\" title=\"Division of Central and Eastern Han by 197, Yuan Shu is uncontested and has the largest area of influence.\" src=\"/static/3f5670c93192da18af913f739657f205/fc2a6/Central%20and%20Eastern%20Han.png\" srcset=\"/static/3f5670c93192da18af913f739657f205/772e8/Central%20and%20Eastern%20Han.png 200w,\n/static/3f5670c93192da18af913f739657f205/e17e5/Central%20and%20Eastern%20Han.png 400w,\n/static/3f5670c93192da18af913f739657f205/fc2a6/Central%20and%20Eastern%20Han.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div>\n    <em>Division of Central and Eastern Han by 197, Yuan Shu is uncontested and has the largest area of influence.</em>\n</div>\n<p>Yuan Shu also had his issues elsewhere dealt with as to the north Liu Bei, Cao Cao, and Lü Bu were all in a standoff and Yuan Shao was busy contesting Gongsun Zan. His only immediate resistance was met on the western borders as Liu Biao was not engaged in any conflict. For this blip of a moment, Yuan Shu was the most powerful warlord in China and could freely focus on matters of political ambition once more.</p>\n<h2>Declaring Intentions</h2>\n<p>At this point, Yuan Shu had not addressed the fact that Emperor Liu Xie was still alive and fell into the hands of Cao Cao, but that didn’t really matter to Yuan Shu. To him he carried an imperial seal and thus, the mandate of heaven. To push matters further, a travelling fortune teller told Yuan Shu that his family was linked to the mythical Emperor Yao who was often associated with the cosmic phrase of earth. To the fortune teller it was only natural that Yuan Shu’s lineage would succeed the Han, who was associated with fire and thus would give way to earth according to the philosophy of Wuxing. He advised Yuan Shu to change the calendar name to Zhong Jia. Although changing the calendar name may not seem like much, it did mean a lot at the time. The emperor would name the calendar with two characters upon ascending and time would be tracked by adding years the emperor had been in power to the name of the calendar. The emperor could also change the name whenever he wished but that would indicate that something drastic had changed to the empire. Anyways, armed with granny science and government legitimacy propaganda, Yuan Shu decided to name a calendar as Zhong Jia, meaning second clan i.e. the second most powerful clan following the Emperor Liu Xie’s clan who would supposedly fade into nothingness. Having acted as an Emperor by naming a calendar, Yuan Shu then decided to fully play the part: building palaces, gathering concubines, and flaunting the imperial seal. This self promotion to the highest post did not see any betterment in Yuan Shu’s character as he continued to be overly decadent and arrogant and ran his land as a powermonger. Many of his courtiers, including Sun Ce, defected out of disgust. An important detail to note is that Yuan Shu never formally declared himself emperor; but through his actions, every warlord in China understood his intentions and once Yuan Shu was marked as an Enemy of the Han, everyone decided to turn against him. After being pursued through China by Cao Cao, Liu Bei, and Lü Bu; Yuan Shu attempted to flee to the north to form an alliance with Yuan Shao. However, the Yuan brothers would never get to repair their bitter rivalry as Yuan Shu’s forces were blocked on the way and he was forced to retreat to Shouchun. Yuan Shu’s final request for a glass of honey water was unfulfilled as he died of starvation in 199, his ostentatious appetite making it impossible for him to swallow the coarse food of his soldiers. The story of Yuan Shu is one where the climax is very short; he spent most of his life accumulating prestige and legitimacy, when he finally had his moment he was the false emperor of Zhong for only two years. For the rest of the Three Kingdoms Period, no character attempted anything near as audacious or reckless as Yuan Shu. Despite big dreams and ambition, Yuan Shu’s legacy fell drastically short. His children fared much better than he did and later on, his daughter, Lady Yuan, became a concubine of the Sun clan and was offered the title of Empress in 238 but refused. His son, Yuan Yao, would become a court advisor at Wu. In retrospect: Yuan Shu’s inability to swallow the low grade food and request for honey water is poetic justice. Even on the death bed, the ever pretentious Yuan Shu could not afford to disgrace himself and it really begs the question of what he could have achieved in his lifetime had he not been so proud and egocentric.</p>\n<div id=\"bibliography\">\r\n<h2>Bibliography</div>\n<p>Book of the Later Han - Fan Ye (445AD)</p>\n<p>Romance of the Three Kingdoms - Luo Guanzhong (C14) [1321 and 1323]</p>\n<p>Book of Han - Ban Gu, Ban Zhao (111AD)</p>\n<p>Record of the Three Kingdoms - Chen Shou (C3)</p>\n<p>A Biographical Dictionary of Later Han to the Three Kingdoms 23-220 AD - Rafe de Crespigny (2007)</p>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"type":"Article","first_name":null,"surname":null,"school":null,"pronouns":null,"role":null,"slug":"/articles/27","profile_picture":null,"title":"The Bizarre Origin of the Zhong Dynasty","composer":null,"subject":"C8792C","userID":null,"articleID":"27","userIDs":["b"],"preview_image":"HanDynasty.jpg","issue":2}},{"html":"<p>Let me introduce you to Mary—she’s a scientist, and a brilliant one at that. Mary is an expert in the study of colour vision. Yet she lives her life confined to a room where absolutely everything is in black and white. Mary has never seen colours, but she has been able to explore and study the world from a black and white monitor screen. Over time, she has learned absolutely everything about how we experience colours. For example, she has discovered the exact way in which specific wavelengths of light from the sky cause us to picture colours in our heads. She knows how our retina is stimulated, how our central nervous system responds, the way we use “red,” or “blue,” to refer to what we’re seeing…simply put, Mary knows all the physical information that there is to know about colour perception. So, what would happen if one day, Mary was released from her black and white room into the world of colour? Would she learn anything new about colour, or not?</p>\n<p>This is the famous 1982 Knowledge Argument, better known to some as “Mary’s Room”, a thought experiment proposed by the philosopher Frank Jackson. It was originally put forward as an argument against Physicalism, which is the view that everything within the universe is made up of physical phenomena. Physicalism suggests that there is nothing to our universe beyond the physical, and nothing, including mental states, that cannot be explained by physical facts. So what implications does Mary have upon this? It seems fairly intuitive to most that even though she knows everything about colour perception, Mary would seem to gain some sort of new information about colour by experiencing it directly, information which she did not possess before. If we admit this, Jackson states, then we’d also have to admit that her original knowledge was in some way incomplete. But Mary originally had all the physical facts about colour perception—nothing’s changed there. Therefore, there must be some information about colour which is non-physical, that is to say, it cannot be reduced to merely physical facts or things. The stance taken by Jackson is that of a dualist point of view, the perspective that there is more to reality than just the physical. Simply put, dualism is the arch-nemesis of physicalism.</p>\n<p>This went on to spark much debate in the world of philosophy. A number of responses arose from the physicalists, determined to undermine this thought experiment which posed such a significant threat to their position, should it be correct. An initial and common objection was the ‘ability hypothesis,’ which suggests that Mary does not learn any new facts about colour, and that the only thing she has gained is the ability to perceive it. Laurence Nemirow and David Lewis in particular argued this case, that Mary has discovered a new ability, rather than new facts. They argue that there are different ‘senses’ of knowledge, and that simply knowing physical facts about colour perception is what is known as propositional knowledge, often described as “knowing that”. Lewis suggests that Mary’s newly gained knowledge is not propositional, but rather, ability knowledge—“knowing how,” as he puts it. She has gained “the abilities to remember, imagine, and recognise” colours. Mary can know that the sky is blue, but she has never learned how to recognise a blue sky. Similarly, Nemirow states that “knowing what an experience is like is the same as knowing how to imagine having the experience,” suggesting that Mary has only learned how to do something new.</p>\n<p>Pretty straightforward, right? Professor Earl Conee would beg to differ. Specifically, he disagrees with Nemirow’s point as given above. Conee suggests that the ability to imagine an experience is not necessary or sufficient in order for someone to know what it’s actually like to have that experience. As part of his argument, he gifts us with the idea of Martha. Martha is a woman who has the incredible ability to visualise “intermediate shades that she has not experienced, between pairs of shades that she has experienced.” If you give Martha two colours and tell her to visualise a shade midway between them, she can do so very accurately. Conee goes on to tell us that Martha has never seen the shade ‘cherry red,’ and knows nothing of it. But if Martha is told that cherry red lies halfway between burgundy red and fire red, which she has experienced, she is now able to visualise cherry red…should she so choose. This is where Conee makes his distinction—Martha has the ability to imagine cherry red, but unless she actually exercises this ability, she will not have the experience of cherry red. From this, Conee goes on to put forward an alternative way of viewing Mary’s problem—he suggests a third kind of knowledge, which he describes as “acquaintance knowledge.” Conee explains acquaintance knowledge as requiring “the person to be familiar with the known entity in the most direct way that it is possible for a person to be aware of that thing,” which, for Mary, would be the direct phenomenal experience of colour. Mary can know all the propositional knowledge that there is to know about colour, but until she actually has an experience where she directly perceives colour, she lacks acquaintance knowledge. While in her room, Mary has yet to gain acquaintance with colours, but when she does so, she doesn’t learn any new physical facts.</p>\n<p>A commonly overlooked case in the knowledge argument, which perhaps should be mentioned more often, is that of Fred, who is Jackson’s other example. He’s not nearly as famous as Mary, but Fred is a man who can distinguish more colours than the average human. Upon being presented with a basket of tomatoes, Fred can see that the basket contains tomatoes of two different shades of red, where everyone else would perceive all the tomatoes to be exactly the same, uniform shade of red. No matter how hard he tries, Fred cannot fully convey to us the difference between the two shades of red, but he is consistently able to discriminate between them. We cannot perceive the same things that Fred can perceive, and Jackson uses this to further evidence what is known as a “phenomenal gap”. Suppose Fred very thoughtfully donates his body to science, and researchers discover the exact differences between his cone cells and ours, and the way that his neurology allows him, with the same stimulus (the tomatoes), to see two shades of red where we only see one. Despite doing all this, we still won’t know exactly what it was like for Fred to perceive these two shades of red. We will never be able to access his perceptual experience with only physical facts, hence there is a gap between what we can discover about Fred’s vision through physical facts, and what it is like to actually see things the way Fred does. Jackson asks us to imagine that we then find a way to surgically alter a normal person’s visual system so that it becomes the same as Fred’s, and they can then perceive colours the same way that he did. He states that upon doing this, the subject would inevitably know more about Fred than they did before the surgery. According to Jackson, this exemplifies the ‘incompleteness’ of physicalism, and supports the dualist view that there must be something more than just the physical facts. This can be subjected to the same critiques as Mary’s scenario, the main difference being that in Fred’s case, we are now the “Marys” of the situation.</p>\n<p>Sometimes an objection is raised that as clever as all these arguments are, they remain theoretical. We still don’t actually know what would happen if we had a real-life Mary in her room. Would she even be able to perceive colour, having lived in a black and white world for her whole life? Neuroscientists V.S. Ramachandran and E.M. Hubbard, while writing articles on synesthesia, noted an example which they describe as comparable to Mary's. They discuss the case study of a colourblind man with numerical synaesthesia, who experiences sensations of seeing certain colours when he looks at certain numbers. There are some shades of colour which he is unable to see in the physical world, and has never seen in his life. However, he claimed that when his synaesthesia was triggered, he’d experience, in his mind, colours which he had never seen before in the world, referring to them as “Martian colours”. He could only perceive these colours through his synaesthetic experiences, and not in any other way. This suggests that acquaintance knowledge of colour may not be quite as straightforward as Conee initially thought, and the actuality of it is that there are more complex neurological processes at play when it comes to experiencing colour. Ramachandran and Hubbard do, however, note that even people with synaesthesia who aren’t colourblind claim that the colours they see “seem ‘foreign’, or ‘alien’”, that they are somehow different to normal colours. They account for this using their hypothesis of ‘cross-wiring’ in the brain, that the wiring of nerves in the brain is ‘blended’, and so in synaesthesia the activation of certain brain cells occurs in an indirect and abnormal manner. This messy cross-wiring may result in what they refer to as “noise”, which causes the Martian colours to appear. This doesn’t necessarily mean that it isn’t possible for the colourblind synaesthete to be perceiving the colours his colourblindness prevents him from seeing, but it does add an element of doubt into the equation. Right now, we don’t have enough research to confirm it one way or the other.</p>\n<p>As is often the case with philosophical conundrums, the knowledge argument never did reach a decisive conclusion. What it did do was to change the landscape of metaphysics and epistemology—and to this day, philosophers are debating the consequences. But as a concluding remark, it’s interesting to note that Jackson eventually changed his mind about his own thought experiment. He now rejects dualism altogether, and states that the thought experiment itself is flawed. If Mary knows all the physical facts about the process in which we perceive colour, then the process of perceiving colour itself must be a physical one, including the mental processes behind it. This would mean that if the experiment were to work, there couldn’t be mental states which were non-physical. Mary’s experience would be self-contradictory, so Jackson actually goes on to accept physicalism. There are some who switched sides along with him, and there are those who declared that they had been right all along. But, as ever, there are still those who disagree, and in doing so, they keep Mary's legacy alive.</p>\n<div id=\"bibliography\">\r\n<h2>Works cited</h2>\n<p>Crane, Tim. “Knowledge argument and knowledge.pages.” Tim Crane, <a href=\"http://www.timcrane.com/uploads/2/5/2/4/25243881/knowledge_argument_and_knowledge.pdf\">http://www.timcrane.com/uploads/2/5/2/4/25243881/knowledge_argument_and_knowledge.pdf</a>.

It has been found that the presence of certain ions as well as the saline level in the ocean water directly affects the possibility of life in this ocean ecosystem. </p>\n</div>\n<p>The sixth largest moon of Saturn and one of the most reflective bodies in the entire solar system is Enceladus. With a rocky core that makes up the majority of the moon, Enceladus is covered by a global ocean trapped under a thick ice crust. The ice crust on Enceladus is thick enough to trap outer space radiation. This cosmic radiation, that includes high energy charged particles or x-rays and gamma rays, are harmful to any type of life. On Earth, our atmosphere protects life on Earth from cosmic radiation, causing life to be able to thrive. But on a moon such as Enceladus, which is very small, it is not able to sustain any atmosphere. However, since Enceladus orbits Saturn, it is far away from the sun, temperatures can fall down to -201 degrees Celsius. This means that any water on the planet should be ice (which is not exactly the case) yet not all of the water present is ice although there is a very thick layer of ice on the top of the planet. This thick layer of ice not only protects the moon from cosmic radiation, but it also makes Enceladus one of the most reflective bodies in our solar system. With the ice sheet covering this ocean world, Enceladus can sustain life without any cosmic radiation from destroying any life it creates.</p>\n<div class=\"image-card-left\">\n    <div class=\"image\">\n        <div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 333px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/1433331434873181afc2ae5768e83e99/24c7e/Enceladus%202.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 55.99999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Enceladus layers\" title=\"Enceladus layers\" src=\"/static/1433331434873181afc2ae5768e83e99/24c7e/Enceladus%202.png\" srcset=\"/static/1433331434873181afc2ae5768e83e99/772e8/Enceladus%202.png 200w,\n/static/1433331434873181afc2ae5768e83e99/24c7e/Enceladus%202.png 333w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div>\n    </div>\n    <p>Enceladus is covered in a global ocean, under the thick layer of ice, making the moon into what is known as an ocean world. The global ocean on Enceladus is created by tidal heating. This occurs due to heating of a cosmic object (sun, satellites, asteroids, planets etc.) that orbits another cosmic object in the universe. Since Enceladus orbits Saturn, the gravitational pull from the planet causes Enceladus to flex, which slightly moves the ice and creates a global underwater ocean. The flexing of the moon causes the ice to slowly melt and create an underwater ocean - it also creates marks that can be seen on the ice above the ocean. This also causes the geysers or jets on Enceladus to be full of water, rather than molten rock (which is what would have been expected).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"image-card-right\">\n    <p>Deep under the surface of Enceladus, just as on Earth, the rocky core of the moon is filled with active hydrothermal activities. This allows for thermal activities on the moon. The fact that it is full of water, and due to the slight expansion of the moon due to tidal heating, allows for hydrothermal vents, just as those on Earth. The vents on Earth are filled with life, so this allows for the possibility of this kind of life to also be present on Earth.</p>\n    <div class=\"image\">\n        <div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 458px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/e33dc2f218b3b34da016fb52c05d4065/f7c3c/Layers.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 99.50000000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Enceladus vents\" title=\"Enceladus vents\" src=\"/static/e33dc2f218b3b34da016fb52c05d4065/f7c3c/Layers.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/e33dc2f218b3b34da016fb52c05d4065/e07e9/Layers.jpg 200w,\n/static/e33dc2f218b3b34da016fb52c05d4065/066f9/Layers.jpg 400w,\n/static/e33dc2f218b3b34da016fb52c05d4065/f7c3c/Layers.jpg 458w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<p>Therefore, since there is liquid water and underwater hydrothermal vents on Enceladus, there is a possibility that there could be life here. The fact that life exists in hydrothermal vents on Earth suggests that there may be a possibility of extremophiles, such as chemotrophs, to live in these underwater vents on Enceladus, where the conditions are similar to the underwater vents on Earth. For example, in the vents there must be sources of sulphur and temperatures must be extremely high, such as those in the underwater hydrothermal vents.</p>\n<p>There are many different types of life on Earth such as plants, which are known as autotrophs, due to the fact that they are able to produce their own food via the process of photosynthesis. However this cannot occur in the depths of the ocean yet there are several organisms that are still able to survive in these conditions. Therefore there must be other processes which occur which have the ability to sustain life in the absence of sunlight. One such process is chemosynthesis carried out by organisms called chemoautotrophs.</p>\n<div class=\"image-card-right\">\n    <p>Chemoautotrophs can be split up into three parts, ‘chemo’ meaning chemicals, ‘auto’ meaning self and ‘troph’ meaning nourishment. Chemoautotrophs produce their own food for energy. There are two different groups of chemoautotrophs depending what type of compound they oxidise to gain their nutrition. If they oxidise organic compounds they are called chemoorganotroph whereas, if they oxidise inorganic compounds then they are called chemolithoautotrophs. Their ability to do chemolithotrophy is what enables them to live in harsh environments. For example the underwater vents present on Enceladus can reach up to 400°C where the pH is also extremely acidic. The most common chemotrophic organisms include bacteria and fungi and, since they are able to make their own nutrition, they are producers in most underwater food chains. </p>\n    <div class=\"image\">\n        <div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 170px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/5518b58cad66e5892105835247f35684/04472/Vent.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 147.05882352941174%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Chemoautotroph\" title=\"Chemoautotroph\" src=\"/static/5518b58cad66e5892105835247f35684/04472/Vent.png\" srcset=\"/static/5518b58cad66e5892105835247f35684/04472/Vent.png 170w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<p>The salinity of the oceans under the ice shell covering the satellite directly affects the thermal properties and tidal cycles of the ocean. If the ocean has too low a salinity there will be limited energy available making the possibility of it being habitable impractical. However Enceladus could have the appropriate level of salinity to sustain life. Hence the tidal cycles can be determined and monitored to show where the heat from the geysers and the ions are transported, which once mapped can show where the habitat of chemotrophs is located. These tidal cycles are also determined by the density of the water in various places of the ocean and therefore the salinity of the ocean is crucial to understanding the tidal cycles as it determines the density of the water. However all of the research about the properties of the oceans is in preliminary stages. Therefore, although little is known today about the salinity and density of the ocean on Enceladus it suggests that under the right conditions Enceladus has the ability to sustain life.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, there are many factors to suggest the possibility of life on Enceladus, such as the presence of underwater vents on the moon and the layer of ice on the surface - which protects the global ocean (where any life would potentially exist) from cosmic radiation. This life could take many forms, but it could also be very similar to the life seen on Earth that inhabits similar underwater vents. The presence of ions such as sulphur and the salinity of the global ocean, also provides more evidence to support the theory of the possibility of life on Enceladus. However, the answer to this question still remains ambiguous, due to the lack of extensive and concrete evidence into the presence of life on Enceladus.</p>\n<div id=\"bibliography\">\r\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\n<p>Enceladus | Science – NASA Solar System Exploration - 19/11/2022 (Available at: <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/science/enceladus/\">https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/science/enceladus/</a>) [1]</p>\n<p>Are There ‘Eyeless Creatures’ On Enceladus?

When we are exposed to music, multiple areas of the brain are stimulated, some more than others. It initiates the release of dopamine and activates the motor cortex, leads to the interaction between both sides of the brain over the corpus callosum, changes the way we feel, and assists memory storage.</p>\n<p>One way music can impact you is by activating the entire limbic system, making us pleased, satisfied or even excited. The limbic system is a complex structure that is involved in learning, memory, and our emotional responses, and it acts as one of the brain’s reward systems. Multiple other reward systems are vital to the experience of pleasure from music. These include the dorsal and ventral striatum, where dopamine can be processed, the limbic system, and of course, the amygdala, a system that processes strong emotions such as fear, anger or pleasure. Dopamine, when released from the hypothalamus and triggered by the music, gives a rewarding, addictive response, similar to eating chocolate. It is a neurotransmitter and hormone that is responsible for pleasurable reward and motivation and is released during musical anticipation. Often when listening to a song, there is a climax or apotheosis that the listener is expecting. A study in Montreal showed that during this anticipation, there is a small release of dopamine in the caudate, a part of the brain near the thalamus, but when the musical climax arrives, there is a large burst of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. The amygdala is also thought to be involved in this process, but it is debatable where the dopamine is actually handled and not fully agreed upon in the scientific community.</p>\n<p>Another hormone that can be controlled by the stimulus of music is cortisol, the stress hormone. The level of cortisol in the body is greatly affected by the music we listen to, increasing when harsh music you don’t like is playing, making you feel agitated and uncomfortable. This also means that when pleasurable music is played, perhaps your favourite song, it can not only increase pleasure and reward but potentially decrease cortisol and stress levels. This joy-inducing, almost instant effect that music has when it activates our reward areas is extremely beneficial to many people and can be seen every day, whether it is using music to improve exercise, listening to a radio or an old record to relax or be artistically inspired. It is evident from the above that music can have a direct and obvious influence on your mood.</p>\n<h2>How playing in a band can benefit you</h2>\n<p>We can see all over the world, that music generally brings people together, in all different cultures and times, going from ancient Greece with drama and plays where music was a popular accompaniment or entertainment, to Indian festivals, African drumming, samba music and many jazz, rock and country bands across the Western world. Music has provided social connections and constructs for millennia, making its own language and ‘feel’ transmissible between people.</p>\n<p>A team of social neuroscientists from Bar-Ilan University and the University of Chicago produced an accurate construction of the social effects of music on the brain which depicts what happens to the brain when playing in an ensemble. By fusing the latest advances in social neuroscience and music, including the theory of evolution, the team highlighted five key functions and mechanisms of the brain that contribute to social connection through music. These areas are empathy circuits, oxytocin secretion, reward and motivation (dopamine release), language structures, and cortisol.</p>\n<p>Empathy helps performers play together and anticipate what others will play, also helping everyone to tune into each other and improving interpersonal musical coordination. Similarly, oxytocin, sometimes called the “love hormone”, contributes to the performer’s sense of feeling socially bonded with others and is secreted when people play together, particularly singing. This is more prominent in ensemble situations as the release of oxytocin is generally associated with other people being part of the performance. In ‘Playing the Pathways of My Brain’ by Olga Bobrovnikova, she considers the audience as included in her performance, even though she is a solo concert pianist.</p>\n<h2>How Music Affects Memory</h2>\n<p>A final impact of music which affects most people in society is the effect on memory.</p>\n<p>Two of the important parts of memory that are vital to this are implicit and explicit memory. Implicit memory, which is one of the two main types of long-term human memory acquired and used unconsciously, affects thoughts and behaviours. In contrast, explicit memory deals with facts and events and requires a conscious effort to retrieve things, such as your address. Memory is processed all over the brain; with implicit memories such as motor memories, relying on the basal ganglia and cerebellum. Whereas explicit memory (episodic and semantic) relies on three important areas of the brain: the neocortex, the amygdala and the hippocampus.</p>\n<p>An incredible feat of musical memory is just how many songs, lyrics and melodic tunes people can remember even years after hearing the song. In an experiment carried out at Western Washington University in October 2015, they researched \"earworms\" - songs that just get stuck in your head. They talk about the rhythm and pattern of a song being a core part of why the music is remembered. That our brains ‘solve’ and remember this puzzle. Daniel Levitin, a renowned music psychologist who studies neuroscience at McGill University, believes that the neural circuits get stuck in a repeating loop, perhaps of a favourite or most memorable part of a song, hence why sometimes you may only be able to remember a line or two, and after thinking about the song itself, the rest may become apparent. Levitin also says that ‘the structures that respond to music in the brain evolved earlier than the structures that respond to language’, and believes that through evolution our bodies have learned to easily memorise music. Since our bodies associate music with pleasure and the release of dopamine is so powerful, the songs that particularly excite us naturally catch our attention which makes them easier to listen to than other songs, and maybe more exciting than conversation. Overall, the entertainment from listening to music makes it more enjoyable, and when dopamine is released, it makes you more willing to remember the song. The certain repetition and rhythm a piece of music has makes the tune easier to memorise and remember, hence the reason most songs are in common time, four beats a bar, and perhaps songs in sextuple compound time (eighteen quavers, or six dotted crotchet beats a bar) may be a lot harsher and more difficult to listen to. This also means that learning facts or data which are set to music in a mnemonic can be incredibly useful, where the rhythmic and melodic templates provide a unique way of remembering the information and a uniquely engaging approach to verbal memory tasks.</p>\n<h2>How a musician’s memory is affected by music</h2>\n<p>Learning music can offer a huge boost to the brain’s memory facilities; trained musicians can create, store, and retrieve memories more rapidly and accurately than non-musicians, showing special improvement in verbal memory. In many experiments, musicians generally have better long-term memory, short-term memory, and working memory than non-musicians, although it is not always the case.</p>\n<p>These benefits can start manifesting in children, particularly from the age of 7. In one test, children with one to five years of musical training and learning were able to remember 20% more vocabulary words read to them off a list than children without musical training. These skills are highly valuable as they can be applied outside the world of music, such as learning a speech, or a language, which could be due to the growing and maturing of their brains at that time.</p>\n<p>It is also amazing how musicians can recall entire songs, learn extremely virtuosic runs on their instrument, or remember what valves to cover on instruments such as the clarinet. How this happens is widely debated, with some crediting repetition, and others claiming sight reading and activating the visual cortex has an impact on the musician remembering music. Primarily, musicians use muscle memory, a type of procedural memory that involves motor learning, in which memories for movement patterns are acquired through repetition. Procedural memory is used for actions such as driving or touch-typing, and not for emotional memories or somewhat musical memories. It allows us to perform complex actions such as virtuosic violin playing with seemingly little attention. This motor-like memory learning is heavily associated with ‘practice makes perfect’, hence the belief of repetition being key in a musician learning whole symphonies.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, this can provide an insight into how music can help you or ways in which you can use music to benefit your life.</p>\n<div id=\"bibliography\">\r\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\n<p>Jäncke L.

To answer your questions, you have wireless power transmission (WPT) to thank, a technique which has been around since the era of Nikola Tesla and has recently become a potential solution to many of our world’s energy supply issues and can revolutionise the way we transmit energy.

The ‘transmitter’ would be connected to a source of power such as a mains power line, where it would use the power to produce time-varying electromagnetic fields, using an antenna device like a coil of wire which generates magnetic fields. This would be aimed at a receiving device (a rectenna). The rectenna, which may be in the form of a coil or metal plate, takes this power and converts it back into DC or AC current using a similar process to the transmitter. This current can then can be consumed by an electrical load such as a mobile device.</p>\n<p>Now this is similar to another process of wireless transmission known as wireless communications, which involves the transfer of energy to a receiver in order to transmit data through electromagnetic waves. The aim of this process is to transmit information successfully, therefore the amount of power transferred is not of great concern. However, in the case of power transmission, the aim is to be efficient as possible to ensure that the receiver gets as much power as possible from the transmitter. As a result of this, WPT is subject to limitations on the distances it can travel thus restricting the use of this technology for long-range use. However, there are two types of WPT techniques that differ based on the region occupied by the oscillating electric and magnetic fields, they are near-field regions and far-field regions. This can allow us to transmit the power over longer distances using several processes.</p>\n<p>A near-field region means that the area is within 1 wavelength of the antenna. The electric and magnetic fields are non-radiative meaning the energy stays close to the transmitter, remaining in the transmitter if there is no receiving device to absorb the energy within the limited range. The size of the antenna devices on both ends has an impact on the size of the fields generated, decreasing exponentially as the distance between the two antennas is greater than their diameters. Since the fields become smaller and smaller, the power transmitted will become very little, rendering it useless for long range transmission. Due to the nature of the near-field components of electric and magnetic fields at relatively larger distances, inductive and capacitive coupling can be used to transmit power over short distances.</p>\n<p>Inductive coupling uses magnetic fields to transfer power between two coils of wire. The combination of these coils forms a transformer. An alternating current is passed through the transmitter coil which produces an oscillating magnetic field as a result of Ampere’s law. This magnetic field passes through the receiver coil and induces an alternating voltage, thus creating an alternating current in the receiver. This alternating current can be used to drive an electrical load for example, an electric toothbrush charging stand. Another proficient use of inductive coupling is charging biomedical prosthetic devices implanted into the body such as a cardiac pacemaker or an insulin pump. This removes the need to pass any wires through the body making it safer and more efficient.</p>\n<p>Similarly, capacitive coupling makes use of electric fields for the transmission of power between two electrodes. This utilises the concepts of capacitance, the capability of an object or device to store electrical charge, for the transfer of power. The transmitter produces an alternating voltage which is then applied to the metal plate, this induces an oscillating electric field into the receiver \tthrough electrostatic induction, forming an alternating current in the load circuit. The amount of power transferred in this process is proportional to the frequency, the voltage squared and the capacitance between the plates, which is affected by the distance separated between the two plates. Due to the fact that large amounts of voltage are applied to the electrodes in order to transfer the power, this technique is typically applied to lower power applications as the voltages can be dangerous. Furthermore, as oppose to magnetic fields, electric fields interact more intensely with most materials, including humans. This potentially could lead to an excessive exposure to electromagnetic fields which can have several health effects on humans leading to dizziness or nerve pain. Despite its hazardous nature, capacitive coupling does have an advantage over inductive coupling. Specifically, in capacitive coupling, the field is confined within the capacitor plates, which reduces the potential of interference whereas inductive coupling requires ‘flux confinement’ cores in order to mitigate this.</p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n    <div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 370px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/cbe270c6af8af294794f677978385725/1efb2/Wireless_power_system.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 40.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Wireless power system\" title=\"Wireless power system\" src=\"/static/cbe270c6af8af294794f677978385725/1efb2/Wireless_power_system.png\" srcset=\"/static/cbe270c6af8af294794f677978385725/772e8/Wireless_power_system.png 200w,\n/static/cbe270c6af8af294794f677978385725/1efb2/Wireless_power_system.png 370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div><em></em>\n</div>\n<p>Resonance can be used on both of these techniques to increase power transfer between the transmitter and receiver. This is achieved through transferring the power by either electric or magnetic fields between two resonant circuits. A resonant circuit consists of an inductor connected to a capacitor; in this case the circuit would contain a coil of wire connected to a capacitor. These two circuits are then tuned to vibrate at the same resonant frequency, amplifying the coupling and power transfer. This technique does come with a few drawbacks, at close ranges the resonant frequency of the system does not remain constant and actually splits into two resonant ‘peaks’. This means that the maximum power transfer is no longer at the original resonant frequency and the system must be tuned to the new resonant peaks. An application of this can be the implementation of power coverage, where a coil in the ceiling can charge electrical components wirelessly within a room such as light bulbs, radios etc. This could lead to potentially reducing the 6 billion batteries disposed each year, contributing to the reduction of toxic waste and groundwater contamination.</p>\n<p>Far field techniques are the conjugate to near-field techniques, also known as radiative techniques. This is where the area is beyond 1 wavelength of the antenna. These methods can achieve much longer ranges often reaching several kilometres in range. High directivity antennas or laser light produce beams of energy that can be made into the shape of the receiving area. Diffraction can have an impact on the maximum directivity of the antennas. In far field techniques, visible light and microwaves are the forms of electromagnetic radiation which are best suited for energy transfer. Microwave power can be made more directional, allowing longer power transfer to be achieved. This technique has been proposed for the transmission of energy from orbiting solar power satellites to Earth and even for spacecrafts leaving orbit. As mentioned earlier, diffraction can impact the directivity of antennas meaning that very large diameters are required. This was discovered by NASA in 1978 when studying solar power satellites and they deduced that they required a 1 kilometre transmitting antenna and a 10-kilometre diameter receiving rectenna for a microwave beam. This can be avoided by using shorter wavelengths however this opens it up to potential atmospheric absorption or blockage from rain or water droplets. Furthermore, power can be transmitted by converting electricity into a laser beam that is received and concentrated onto photovoltaic cells. These cells are designed to convert light energy into electricity using the photoelectric effect. This method does hold a few advantages over microwaves for example, the use of collimated monochromatic wavefront propagation allows narrow beam cross-sectional areas for transmission over large distances. This allows it to transfer further without a loss in power. The use of light also means there is no chance of radio-frequency interference making it more efficient. However, there are also some disadvantages of using light beams as they can be dangerous, potentially blinding humans and other animals and even being lethal to both. Also, the conversion between light and electricity is limited as the photovoltaic cells have a maximum efficiency of around 40%-50%. Despite being unaffected by radio frequency, light beams are subject to atmospheric absorption from rain and clouds and could lead to losses of up to 100%. This idea has been implemented in military weapons and aerospace applications and is commonly used for powering commercial and consumer electronics. Due to its potential dangers, laser beam technology must satisfy laser safety requirements set by the IEC.</p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n    <div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/65fcc7b814a1d028d6e3297278982384/8ec0a/guru-wireless-charging-header-scaled.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 55.99999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Wireless charging dock\" title=\"Wireless charging dock\" src=\"/static/65fcc7b814a1d028d6e3297278982384/4b190/guru-wireless-charging-header-scaled.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/65fcc7b814a1d028d6e3297278982384/e07e9/guru-wireless-charging-header-scaled.jpg 200w,\n/static/65fcc7b814a1d028d6e3297278982384/066f9/guru-wireless-charging-header-scaled.jpg 400w,\n/static/65fcc7b814a1d028d6e3297278982384/4b190/guru-wireless-charging-header-scaled.jpg 800w,\n/static/65fcc7b814a1d028d6e3297278982384/e5166/guru-wireless-charging-header-scaled.jpg 1200w,\n/static/65fcc7b814a1d028d6e3297278982384/b17f8/guru-wireless-charging-header-scaled.jpg 1600w,\n/static/65fcc7b814a1d028d6e3297278982384/8ec0a/guru-wireless-charging-header-scaled.jpg 2560w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div><em></em>\n</div>\n<p>We have explored how WPT works and all the different techniques within the area, looking at a few applications of this process. Let’s look into more current applications and potential applications which can benefit the world greatly.</p>\n<p>The inequality of reliable electricity access in the world is huge, having a key impact on economic progress and prosperity. Remote islands and farms rely on underwater cables or single lines through difficult terrains. These lines require expensive installation and maintenance and can prohibit people from gaining a reliable power source. WPT offers a solution to these expensive infrastructure upgrades and maintenance over challenging terrain. For example, Stewart Island, a nature reserve could be powered by beaming sustainably generated hydro-energy, reducing the reliance on diesel generators and reducing overall costs for communities and residents. Some areas such as Piha, a costal island in New Zealand, are tucked away behind mountainous terrain and experiences strong winds and storms. This makes it difficult for power lines to remain intact and functionable all year round. WPT can be a significantly cheaper option to install and maintain compared to these power lines as it can overcome these traditional obstacles of terrain and weather. Additionally, WPT could potentially allow us replace generators which have been a common and crucial component of our technological lives. Replacing them means we don’t have to deal with their high running costs, pollution, noisiness, and the hassle from outages. WPT can reduce outage downtime and costs without the need for a generator.</p>\n<p>Essentially, WPT and WPT technologies require a direct line of sight between the transmitter and receiver to successfully transfer the energy. In reality we can use this technology for almost anything! With further developments and research into this field, we can imagine a world full of fuel-free vehicles and wirelessly charged electrical components. For example, we could power electric cars or ships even aeroplanes during flight, making our world a much cleaner and cheaper environment to live in. This technology has endless possibilities just waiting to be exploited by aspiring scientists and engineers.

Picture your pet; that small ball of fluff or scales that brings you so much joy in your life. A constant form of affection that’s almost as close to you as a child. Your responsibility to care for and nurture. A constant friend through tough times. So, it is no surprise that politicians from all backgrounds, left, right, liberal, or conservative want to hijack your hamster, corrupt your cat and phish your fish  in order to manipulate you politically. Even though this political tool is being used globally, there is no need to fret. This article will seek to wake you from the illusion whilst giving you key steps in order to stop The Powers That Be influencing you, a map to the minefield if you will. And this minefield is littered with “Beware” signs, as these tactics have been and are being used to cover up racism and bigotry everywhere.</p>\n<p>We as a species are naturally drawn to cuteness<sup>1</sup>. Large eyes and soft features, like those of a human infant, trigger our parental instincts<sup>1</sup>. Animals that don’t exhibit these two main characteristics are far less likely to be our pets, as animals like insects trigger disgust. “Disgust is a learned emotion…. It’s probably transmitted socially” according to Graham Davey, specialist in phobia at Sussex University<sup>1</sup>. Therefore, it should be no surprise that the animals we welcome voluntarily into our homes represent this. Statistically speaking, 3/5 of readers will have a pet<sup>2</sup>, dogs being ever so slightly more popular than cats, 12.5 million to 12.2 million<sup>2</sup> (sorry cat people). Out of these animal lovers, 49% would say that their pet is a family member in its own right<sup>2</sup>. The sheer volume of pets, not just in the UK but around the world, is fruit ripe for the picking of politicians in need of public support, preying on our parental and familial instincts to do so. This is done for a plethora of end goals, but perhaps the most pertinent is for the ultimate of being relatable.</p>\n<h2>Relatability</h2>\n<p>It is commonly joked that in American politics, “if you want a friend in Washington get a dog”, and this idea has been taken to the advantage of politicians in the House. In the first television advert of his campaign, Democratic Representative John Barrow let loose a Golden Retriever, the nuclear bomb of relatability, whilst citing the famous joke<sup>3</sup>. “ Well, I wouldn’t wish Washington on a dog” he adds, as he launches a tennis ball for her off screen, using the down time to criticise other state lawmakers<sup>3</sup>. When she returns, he quips “She works harder than most of them do”. In the 2012 house election, he defeated the incumbent, popular and previously unopposed House Representative  Lee Anderson by a 6.6% margin<sup>4</sup>. Barrow had never run in an election previously <sup>4</sup>. Now I’m not saying his dog was the sole reason for his election, however, A golden retriever is absolutely ideal in order to become relatable with the public. According to the aptly named Daily Paws, the breed is amongst the most popular in the States in families, displaying key traits of affection friendliness, capability, and trustworthiness<sup>5</sup>.The inclusion of the family pet for the family man, one who can be depended on, in this advert whether consciously or subconsciously triggers a reaction. This reaction is to affiliate all of those characteristics to Barrow. He is now just like you and I, using the double headed dog hammer of family and reliability to ensure that you vote for him.</p>\n<p>This issue is happening on a far grander stage, just across La Manche in France as well. Everybody’s favourite far-right, Holocaust denying sycophant (what, I never said the article wasn’t politically charged) has now, like a shark sniffing blood, caught on to the scent of those sweet relatability points. For those unaware, the Le Pen family has somewhat lost its footing in the political landscape of France in recent times, most of that coming down to the fact people are less supportive of racist bigots. But in order to distance herself from her father’s comments that gas chambers were a mere “detail” of the Nazi’s in 1987<sup>6</sup>, Le Pen has been using cats to win popularity. In her 2022 Presidential campaign, her social media was a flood of images of her with cats. Here are a couple of my favourites:</p>\n<div class=\"image\">\n    <div class=\"img\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 628px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/b7a6d5a718faa22e3f0e1f4038e71435/3d84d/MarineLepen.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 89.99999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Marine Lepen\" title=\"Marine Lepen\" src=\"/static/b7a6d5a718faa22e3f0e1f4038e71435/3d84d/MarineLepen.png\" srcset=\"/static/b7a6d5a718faa22e3f0e1f4038e71435/772e8/MarineLepen.png 200w,\n/static/b7a6d5a718faa22e3f0e1f4038e71435/e17e5/MarineLepen.png 400w,\n/static/b7a6d5a718faa22e3f0e1f4038e71435/3d84d/MarineLepen.png 628w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span></div>\n    <em>Courtesy of @marine_lepen</em>\n</div>\n<p>Put in context of the horrendous comments of her party’s (Rassemblement Nationale) incredibly far right policies, it is sickening to see what she is doing. For example, she would like to cut the essential and often lifesaving aid given to illegal immigrants into France, by abolishing the AME<sup>7</sup>. The aide médicale d’Etat, according to her, is a “suction pump”<sup>7</sup> bringing illegal immigrants into the country, when in fact saves the lives of those most in need. Not only this, but she wants any foreign nationals who break the law in France to be stripped of their French Nationality, and deportation of those who commit “serious crimes”<sup>7</sup>.  When seen, without these policies, and just with these photos and the caption “First Cat”<sup>6</sup> it is easy to see how she can become very relatable, so relatable that she was projected to win 40% of the vote<sup>6</sup>. This is the highest majority RN has ever won<sup>6</sup> and the only one in which she has made a point about her ailurophilia. Even though she thankfully lost the election, she has gained political legitimacy, with her party’s historic (and present) racist and homophobic policies being almost forgotten because she owns pets. She has become amongst the French a respectable politician<sup>6</sup> due to this boost of public relatability facilitated by kittens, a terrifying prospect due to the threat to the liberties of so many that she poses.</p>\n<p>However, sometimes this love for animals backfires dramatically on politicians, and a recent example relates to everybody’s favourite British PM. Yes, if COVID, marital, party and economic scandal weren’t enough for Boris Johnson, his slip ups with animals which inevitably would have been used for a publicity win, show us how this issue is closer than one might be ready to admit. Upon the Taliban takeover of Kabul in Afghanistan, a massive British force was mobilised to conduct an immediate evacuation of interests there<sup>8</sup>. But human interests were not the only thing on Boris’ mind. In a leaked email to the Foreign Office, an official stated that the animal charity Nowzad had “received a lot of publicity” and made a claim that “the PM had authorised their staff and animals to be evacuated”<sup>8</sup>. On the same day, a private charter was organised by Johnsons private secretary to secure the evacuation of the animals<sup>8</sup>. When quizzed about why he left Afghans who worked for Britain behind, in favour for airlifting dogs, Johnson stated that it was “complete nonsense”<sup>8</sup>. As we all know, when Boris says, “complete nonsense” the British public knows it to actually be “completely factual” and it was revealed that 173 dogs and cats had indeed been evacuated in August<sup>8</sup>. This caused outcry in both the media and in government and was a factor in bringing Boris Johnsons house of cards to come tumbling down and brought fresh allegations into him misleading Parliament. The British evacuation was in general a catastrophe for the Conservative administration, but what was the icing on the cake is that seemingly out of the kindness of his heart, Johnson decided to save the animals. From what we have previously learnt, there is no such thing, and it is highly likely that this was a move that, had the evacuation been conducted better by the army and received better by the public, would have been released to brand Boris as a relatable and caring figure, for animals, not just people. However, the reality is that Johnsons attempt to use animals as political leverage was yet another failure of his government.</p>\n<h2>The Impacts</h2>\n<p>The relatability gained by having pets has been capitalised on by every politician guilty of doing it. There are indirect examples of the popularity helping to pass laws and policies that may not have passed ordinarily. However, one example of a direct impact that pets have had on politics is in passing one of the most controversial laws in American history. On the 19th of April 1995, an ex-Army soldier called Timothy McVeigh parked a rental truck outside a federal building  in Oklahoma City. After getting into a separate getaway vehicle, he pushed a button and killed 168 people<sup>9</sup>. The tragedy of the Oklahoma City bombing remains pertinent in American minds to this day and was used as evidence for the necessity of the Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996<sup>10</sup>. Lawmakers jumped at this opportunity, and the law allowed the State to admit illegally obtained evidence to a case, deny the defendant access to it, and only allows the defendant the bare minimum of state defence<sup>9</sup>. Furthermore, it heavily restricted freedom of speech in allowing the ability to shut down any anti-State rhetoric. The article was criticised for “sacrificing the individual liberties and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution for a “quick” solution to terrorism”<sup>9</sup>, with this being specifically worded to target ethnic minorities. Whilst this was being passed, the Clinton administration attempted to draw public attention away from the clear breaches of human rights by a school campaign about his pets. Journalist Nathan Robinson remembers that he was taught about Bill Clinton’s cat Socks and dog Buddy<sup>11</sup>. The American youth were encouraged to write in letters to the pets across 1996, the campaign being so publicised, that Socks and Buddy received over 300,000 letters<sup>12</sup>. Instead of having one of the most controversial and racially motivated bills in American history<sup>9</sup> being discussed, the public were more enamoured asking questions such as “How does it feel to be top cat?”<sup>10</sup>. This public blindsiding was one of the first policies used by Clinton in his presidential campaign for re-election in 1996, and the public adoration of his pets was used to stop questions being asked about this radical new policy. Not only this but to ensure that his opinion polls remained high after the midterm elections, he commissioned his wife Hilary Clinton to publish a book entitled Dear Socks, Dear Buddy in 1998<sup>10</sup>. Conveniently, this collection of 80 heart-warming letters was released soon after the case of American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm, v. Reno<sup>9</sup>. The case directly criticised the reduction in freedom of speech and the laws targeting of many plaintiffs due to group affiliation<sup>9</sup> and was one of the first cases where the government was questioned over the wording and application of the law. In publishing this collection of letters now, which were first written at the time the law was passed<sup>11</sup> again further draws public and media attention away from discussing the Death Penalty Act.  It is clear that Clinton persistently and unceremoniously used Socks and Buddy to divert public attention from human rights abuses and towards him being a relatable and kind-hearted politician.</p>\n<h2>What do we do now?</h2>\n<p>The premise of this article is not as a fearmongering tactic. But in a world were chasms are being carved into society before our very eyes, it is important that we do not become blindfolded and fall into them. This article does however invite you to ask questions about what you see in political campaigns. To take that one extra step and ask why. Why is Le Pen holding a cat? Why is Clinton releasing a book about his pets? Why is Boris evacuating cats and dogs from Afghanistan? We hold our pets so dear to our lives that we owe them a service to not let their cute little faces fall into the malicious hands of the world elite. In a society where it can seem as though politics is inescapable, let us try to pry our pets from their grip, for it is what they deserve.</p>\n<p>Unconditional love is too valuable to lose.</p>\n<div id=\"bibliography\">\r\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p><sup>1</sup>Cute or creepy: Why we love some species, loathe others - cute or creepy (2019) The Economic Times.
