This star appears to be the most distant one ever seen. Its light began traveling some 12.9 billion years before it reached Earth. That's about 4 billion years longer than the former record holder.</p>\n<p>Researchers reported the news March 30 in Nature.</p>\n<p>The universe includes all things that are found today in space and time. Studying this early starlight could help researchers learn more about what the universe was like when it was very young. It is now about 13.8 billion years old.</p>\n<p>\"These are the sorts of things that you only hope you could discover,\" says astronomer Katherine Whitaker. She works at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. She did not take part in the new study.</p>\n<p>The newfound object appears in images of a cluster of galaxies taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. The sun is one of hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy, so these images from Hubble show ginormous numbers of stars. That one cluster alone contains many galaxies. These galaxy clusters can bend and focus light that comes from things even farther away. Such a bending of light is known as gravitational lensing.</p>\n<p>In images of one galaxy cluster, a group of astronomers from around the world noticed a long, thin red arc. That team includes Brian Welch from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Md. The team realized that the arc was made of light from a galaxy located even farther away than the ones they were studying. The light from this background galaxy had been stretched and magnified.</p>\n<p>Atop that red arc, the researchers found one bright spot they think is too small to be a small galaxy or a cluster of stars. \"We stumbled into finding\" this ancient star, Welch explains.</p>\n<p>His team now estimates that the starlight they spotted was from only 900 million years after the Big Bang.

That telescope, also known as JWST, will begin studying the distant universe this summer.</p>\n<p>JWST can pick up light from more distant objects than can Hubble.

That is, fascists try to solve problems stemming from economic inequalities and ethnic divisions by placing the nation-state above the individual while evening the economic playing field for those who ardently identify with them. At the same time, those who do not share the same level of approval for fascism become the “enemy” or “opposition.” Unsurprisingly, fascists work to debase the claims of their “enemies” through political attacks, conspiracy theories, charges of disloyalty, and physical violence.</p>\n<p>To fascists, the ideological significance of violence is an important part of who they are since they understand themselves to be at “war” with mainstream governments.5 Consequently, by joining with like-minded individuals, and forming subcultural groups which usually feature militaristic ranks, fascists attempt to embody their “battle” with the status-quo through comradery. Lastly, fascism, as a counter-cultural belief system, necessarily needs an ideological “opposition” to thrive, because without an “enemy” there would be no “war” to wage.</p>\n<p>To Mann, Fascists – though usually highly-educated, idealistic, and fervent in their political views – nevertheless believe violence is a moral and efficient way to solve divisions in society. To fascists, it is the right of the nation-state to combat its “enemies,” to maintain its national character. In other words, fascists believe the nation-state should be homogenous, so the cultural aspects defining it remain untainted, even if it calls for physical force.</p>\n<h3>Fascists claim that statism is the surest way to eradicate economic disparities in society. This ultimately leads to fascism’s goal of global totalitarian corporate bodies, vying for economic dominance.</h3>\n<p>Furthermore, fascists claim statism is the surest way to eradicate economic disparities in society. That is, the economic vision associated with fascism is unionization of the masses which would organically form a corporate entity or the state. To fascists, the surest way to achieve this financial arrangement is a blend of nationalism, to unite people and socialism to syndicate labor. Accordingly, this would lead to fascism’s goal of a nation where there is no interstate competition, but rather global totalitarian corporate bodies, vying for economic dominance.</p>\n<p>Obedience is central to fascist economic projects since it is when everyone plays his or her part for the benefit of the nation-state that it can take on other national economies. Accordingly, violence used against those who do not comply with fascists economic fantasies is moral since individuality is incompatible with obedience, and threatens the unity of the nation.To avoid disobedience, it is not uncommon for fascists leaders to prey on the masses through populist promises, and excessive praise of the “successes” of the nation.</p>\n<p>Moreover, absolute submission to the nation-state is paramount to fascist financial schemes since to dominate the world economically all laborers must work as one. In other words, fascists believe only cohesive labor forces can challenge the economies of other states since their oneness gels with the transcendent unity of the nation. Consequently, unquestioning and unwavering dedication to one’s workforce is crucial because without it economic inequality within the nation could emerge, stopping it from being a state in the fascist's sense. Lastly, through a fascist lens, ferocity against those who do not labor for the benefit of the nation-state is permissible since they jeopardize its economic mission.</p>","frontmatter":{"type":"Article","first_name":null,"surname":null,"school":null,"pronouns":null,"role":null,"slug":"/articles/d98a9a05-fdf5-42b3-b913-1679084cece9","profile_picture":null,"title":"The Fundamental Illegitimacy of Facism","subject":"CDCEED","userID":"aa40995c-750c-4a48-b1b0-e7bfb15e4cd4","articleID":"d98a9a05-fdf5-42b3-b913-1679084cece9","preview_image":"Facism.jpg","video_url":null,"issue":2}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>Cardioid, derived from a Greek word, meaning 'heart', is a curve traced out by a point on the circumference of a circle rolling around another circle (given both these circles have equal radius).

The cells were treated initially with different concentrations of IAPP (ranging from 10 μM to 1 nM) for 24 h. Monomers and oligomers of IAPP are known to cross the plasma membrane through both endocytotic and non-endocytotic mechanisms in these cells [23]. The viability of Rin-5F cells was reduced with IAPP concentrations from 10 μM to 250 nM (Fig. 1), though there was little change above 5 μM. Addition of DMSO at the same concentrations had no effect on viability (not shown), showing that loss of viability is solely due to IAPP. 5 μM IAPP was therefore used for subsequent work, as the minimal concentration that gives a large change in cell viability. An MTT assay at 5 μM was then carried out to identify the optimal time points at which the IAPP cytotoxicity effect had the largest effect on Rin5F cells’ viability (Fig. 2). The cells’ viability was sharply reduced 2 h after the addition of IAPP and did not change significantly between 2 h to 32 h, after which the MTT signal increased slightly. The 5 μM IAPP concentration with an exposure time of 24 h was therefore used for further experiments. In Rin5F cells, 10 μM IAPP causes less than 20% cell death, whilst 20 μM is required for complete cell death [24]. This conclusion is not dependent on using MTT, as other toxicity assays (e.g. live/dead) show the same result [25]. A concentration of 10 μM is typically used to induce apoptosis [26, 27]. Effects of IAPP on the cells under our conditions will therefore show damaging effects of IAPP before the onset of apoptosis.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/565f8901cbe4601b41c7ac36d1e9b857/fcbaf/IAPPConcentrationGraph.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 62%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Graph of MTT Reduction against IAPP Concentration\"\n        title=\"Graph of MTT Reduction against IAPP Concentration\"\n        src=\"/static/565f8901cbe4601b41c7ac36d1e9b857/5a190/IAPPConcentrationGraph.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/565f8901cbe4601b41c7ac36d1e9b857/772e8/IAPPConcentrationGraph.png 200w,\n/static/565f8901cbe4601b41c7ac36d1e9b857/e17e5/IAPPConcentrationGraph.png 400w,\n/static/565f8901cbe4601b41c7ac36d1e9b857/5a190/IAPPConcentrationGraph.png 800w,\n/static/565f8901cbe4601b41c7ac36d1e9b857/fcbaf/IAPPConcentrationGraph.png 895w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>We used OFFGEL™ proteomics to study how IAPP exposure affects the proteome of rat pancreatic insulinoma Rin-5F cells. The OFFGEL™ methodology is highly effective at generating quantitative data on hundreds of proteins affected by IAPP, with its accuracy confirmed by In Cell Western and Quantitative Real Time PCR results. Combining data on individual proteins identifies pathways and protein complexes affected by IAPP. IAPP disrupts protein synthesis and degradation, and induces oxidative stress. It causes decreases in protein transport and localization. IAPP disrupts the regulation of ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation and increases catabolic processes. IAPP causes decreases in protein transport and localization, and affects the cytoskeleton, DNA repair and oxidative stress.</p>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>Results are consistent with a model where IAPP aggregates overwhelm the ability of a cell to degrade proteins via the ubiquitin system. Ultimately this leads to apoptosis. IAPP aggregates may be also toxic to the cell by causing oxidative stress, leading to DNA damage or by decreasing protein transport. The reversal of any of these effects, perhaps by targeting proteins which alter in response to IAPP, may be beneficial for type II diabetes.</p>","frontmatter":{"type":"Article","first_name":null,"surname":null,"school":null,"pronouns":null,"role":null,"slug":"/articles/cb2cd7a4-41f7-4989-ae89-87aeb64803fc","profile_picture":null,"title":"Effect of IAPP on the proteome of cultured Rin-5F cells","subject":"2BB760","userID":"ba8c2047-d40a-4441-ba57-9a6fb94381f9","articleID":"cb2cd7a4-41f7-4989-ae89-87aeb64803fc","preview_image":"BioChemImg1.png","video_url":null,"issue":2}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/profiles/11360970-c0d2-42d8-baf0-802b9a031281"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
