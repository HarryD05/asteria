The peptide is suggested to be involved in the etiology of the disease through formation of amyloid deposits and destruction of β islet cells, though the underlying molecular events leading from IAPP deposition to β cell death are still largely unknown.","subject":"2BB760","issue":2,"preview_image":"BioChemImg1.png","slug":"/articles/cb2cd7a4-41f7-4989-ae89-87aeb64803fc"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Cardioid: The heart of Pascal's Limaçon","description":"Cycloid really has been the fame of the seventeenth century, but more importantly it led to the possibility of a circle moving around or inside another circle. This is when all the possible kinds of curves started to emerge, starting from hypotrochoids to epicycloids to other innumerable curves. Among these, Cardioid is a curve that belongs to Limaçon of Pascal (discovered by Étienne Pascal).","subject":"3E5FCA","issue":2,"preview_image":"Cardioid.jpg","slug":"/articles/8d9520b0-94ba-44c6-97bd-2d5a8e7e45cc"}}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
