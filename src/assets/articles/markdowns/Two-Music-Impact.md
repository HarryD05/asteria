Music impacts our brains in a variety of ways. When we are exposed to music, multiple areas of the brain are stimulated, some more than others. It initiates the release of dopamine and activates the motor cortex, leads to the interaction between both sides of the brain over the corpus callosum, changes the way we feel, and assists memory storage.

One way music can impact you is by activating the entire limbic system, making us pleased, satisfied or even excited. The limbic system is a complex structure that is involved in learning, memory, and our emotional responses, and it acts as one of the brain’s reward systems. Multiple other reward systems are vital to the experience of pleasure from music. These include the dorsal and ventral striatum, where dopamine can be processed, the limbic system, and of course, the amygdala, a system that processes strong emotions such as fear, anger or pleasure. Dopamine, when released from the hypothalamus and triggered by the music, gives a rewarding, addictive response, similar to eating chocolate. It is a neurotransmitter and hormone that is responsible for pleasurable reward and motivation and is released during musical anticipation. Often when listening to a song, there is a climax or apotheosis that the listener is expecting. A study in Montreal showed that during this anticipation, there is a small release of dopamine in the caudate, a part of the brain near the thalamus, but when the musical climax arrives, there is a large burst of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. The amygdala is also thought to be involved in this process, but it is debatable where the dopamine is actually handled and not fully agreed upon in the scientific community.

Another hormone that can be controlled by the stimulus of music is cortisol, the stress hormone. The level of cortisol in the body is greatly affected by the music we listen to, increasing when harsh music you don’t like is playing, making you feel agitated and uncomfortable. This also means that when pleasurable music is played, perhaps your favourite song, it can not only increase pleasure and reward but potentially decrease cortisol and stress levels. This joy-inducing, almost instant effect that music has when it activates our reward areas is extremely beneficial to many people and can be seen every day, whether it is using music to improve exercise, listening to a radio or an old record to relax or be artistically inspired. It is evident from the above that music can have a direct and obvious influence on your mood. 
 
## How playing in a band can benefit you
We can see all over the world, that music generally brings people together, in all different cultures and times, going from ancient Greece with drama and plays where music was a popular accompaniment or entertainment, to Indian festivals, African drumming, samba music and many jazz, rock and country bands across the Western world. Music has provided social connections and constructs for millennia, making its own language and ‘feel’ transmissible between people.

A team of social neuroscientists from Bar-Ilan University and the University of Chicago produced an accurate construction of the social effects of music on the brain which depicts what happens to the brain when playing in an ensemble. By fusing the latest advances in social neuroscience and music, including the theory of evolution, the team highlighted five key functions and mechanisms of the brain that contribute to social connection through music. These areas are empathy circuits, oxytocin secretion, reward and motivation (dopamine release), language structures, and cortisol.

Empathy helps performers play together and anticipate what others will play, also helping everyone to tune into each other and improving interpersonal musical coordination. Similarly, oxytocin, sometimes called the “love hormone”, contributes to the performer’s sense of feeling socially bonded with others and is secreted when people play together, particularly singing. This is more prominent in ensemble situations as the release of oxytocin is generally associated with other people being part of the performance. In ‘Playing the Pathways of My Brain’ by Olga Bobrovnikova, she considers the audience as included in her performance, even though she is a solo concert pianist.
 
## How Music Affects Memory
A final impact of music which affects most people in society is the effect on memory. 

Two of the important parts of memory that are vital to this are implicit and explicit memory. Implicit memory, which is one of the two main types of long-term human memory acquired and used unconsciously, affects thoughts and behaviours. In contrast, explicit memory deals with facts and events and requires a conscious effort to retrieve things, such as your address. Memory is processed all over the brain; with implicit memories such as motor memories, relying on the basal ganglia and cerebellum. Whereas explicit memory (episodic and semantic) relies on three important areas of the brain: the neocortex, the amygdala and the hippocampus.

An incredible feat of musical memory is just how many songs, lyrics and melodic tunes people can remember even years after hearing the song. In an experiment carried out at Western Washington University in October 2015, they researched "earworms" - songs that just get stuck in your head. They talk about the rhythm and pattern of a song being a core part of why the music is remembered. That our brains ‘solve’ and remember this puzzle. Daniel Levitin, a renowned music psychologist who studies neuroscience at McGill University, believes that the neural circuits get stuck in a repeating loop, perhaps of a favourite or most memorable part of a song, hence why sometimes you may only be able to remember a line or two, and after thinking about the song itself, the rest may become apparent. Levitin also says that ‘the structures that respond to music in the brain evolved earlier than the structures that respond to language’, and believes that through evolution our bodies have learned to easily memorise music. Since our bodies associate music with pleasure and the release of dopamine is so powerful, the songs that particularly excite us naturally catch our attention which makes them easier to listen to than other songs, and maybe more exciting than conversation. Overall, the entertainment from listening to music makes it more enjoyable, and when dopamine is released, it makes you more willing to remember the song. The certain repetition and rhythm a piece of music has makes the tune easier to memorise and remember, hence the reason most songs are in common time, four beats a bar, and perhaps songs in sextuple compound time (eighteen quavers, or six dotted crotchet beats a bar) may be a lot harsher and more difficult to listen to. This also means that learning facts or data which are set to music in a mnemonic can be incredibly useful, where the rhythmic and melodic templates provide a unique way of remembering the information and a uniquely engaging approach to verbal memory tasks. 

## How a musician’s memory is affected by music
Learning music can offer a huge boost to the brain’s memory facilities; trained musicians can create, store, and retrieve memories more rapidly and accurately than non-musicians, showing special improvement in verbal memory. In many experiments, musicians generally have better long-term memory, short-term memory, and working memory than non-musicians, although it is not always the case.

These benefits can start manifesting in children, particularly from the age of 7. In one test, children with one to five years of musical training and learning were able to remember 20% more vocabulary words read to them off a list than children without musical training. These skills are highly valuable as they can be applied outside the world of music, such as learning a speech, or a language, which could be due to the growing and maturing of their brains at that time.

It is also amazing how musicians can recall entire songs, learn extremely virtuosic runs on their instrument, or remember what valves to cover on instruments such as the clarinet. How this happens is widely debated, with some crediting repetition, and others claiming sight reading and activating the visual cortex has an impact on the musician remembering music. Primarily, musicians use muscle memory, a type of procedural memory that involves motor learning, in which memories for movement patterns are acquired through repetition. Procedural memory is used for actions such as driving or touch-typing, and not for emotional memories or somewhat musical memories. It allows us to perform complex actions such as virtuosic violin playing with seemingly little attention. This motor-like memory learning is heavily associated with ‘practice makes perfect’, hence the belief of repetition being key in a musician learning whole symphonies. 

Hopefully, this can provide an insight into how music can help you or ways in which you can use music to benefit your life.
