title: "Cardioid: The heart of Pascal's Limaçon"
description: "Cycloid really has been the fame of the seventeenth century, but more importantly it led to the possibility of a circle moving around or inside another circle. This is when all the possible kinds of curves started to emerge, starting from hypotrochoids to epicycloids to other innumerable curves. Among these, Cardioid is a curve that belongs to Limaçon of Pascal (discovered by Étienne Pascal)."

Cardioid, derived from a Greek word, meaning 'heart', is a curve traced out by a point on the circumference of a circle rolling around another circle (given both these circles have equal radius). Cardioid is one of the special cases seen under the family of curves called the Limaçon.

Cardioid created by two circles
Limaçon is a roulette formed the same way the Cardioid is, except it does not have a cusp, i.e., the tracing point either lies inside or outside the generating circle and it is possible to obtain dimpled curves with blunt cusps or looped curves.

Types of curves identified as Limaçon

To understand these curves, let’s begin by considering the equation of a Limaçon in polar coordinates:
r = b + a cosθ

When b > a, a simple closed curve is obtained and when b < a (provided b>0), an inner loop is formed i.e., the curve crosses itself at the origin.

However, when b = a, the general equation of the horizontal Cardioid

is obtained, i.e., r = 1 + cosθ. Since this is the special case, the Cardioid is often referred as the sinusoidal spiral curve.
