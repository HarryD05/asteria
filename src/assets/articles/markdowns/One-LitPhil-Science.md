## Part 1

'Science', as is framed in the question, is a slightly nebulous term, so I'm interpreting it to mean 'the use of an objective scientific method' [1]. Therefore, when I say, 'the science has told us not to eat McDonald's', what I mean is that 'multiple concordant studies in recent times have concluded that eating McDonald's out of moderation will result in long-term weight gain' [2].

While that makes sense, it does include a quick sleight of hand on my part which is worth exploring. In the second statement, I assumed that the implicit objective of the first was to maintain good health. The phrase 'Should I eat McDonald's?' by itself has no aim contained within it, so technically speaking, we can't answer.

While it holds colloquially, even if I had asked, 'Should I eat McDonald's to avoid gaining weight?', it's still difficult to reply in a yes or no fashion. A rigorous answer would take into account genetic factors; the other parts of your diet and lifestyle, specifically how much McDonald's; and so on to ultimately determine whether you would gain weight.

Therefore, every time we use the word 'should', it's necessary that we supply an objective – i.e., a larger aim within which the action I 'should' or 'shouldn't' take lies – and that we supply the necessary context that would apply to the question.

It's necessary to clarify that by saying '...how should we live?', I'm assuming that 'live' can be broken down into a series of more specific verbs. It's more productive to consider ‘how should we live?’ to mean how we should act in a finite and limited situation – and then assume that 'life' as a whole refers to a series of overlapping finite situations – rather than by trying to wrestle with fundamentally how we should live our entire lives start to finish in one go. We might end up there but it's not a useful place to start.

It's also important to clarify why I'm able to use the phrase 'the science' so easily, and why I intend to for the rest of the essay. As mentioned, I'm interpreting 'science' to be a method that ensures objectivity and lack of error. Therefore, 'science', in any capacity, can refer to both the existing research of our time – i.e., currently published work on the health effects of McDonald's – as well as the hypothetical research we haven't taken yet – i.e., the implications of McDonald's that we're yet to discover. After all, both of which still fall under the domain of science, given that the correct method is used. Therefore, it's possible to say a phrase like, 'although science can't tell us how we should act right now, if we had the right technology and method, then it could'. And given that 'science' in this case refers simply to a universal method – to quote Carl Sagan [7], "Science is more than a body of knowledge. It's a way of thinking, a way of sceptically interrogating the universe with a fine understanding of human fallibility," – we should be able to consider both existing science (research we have already taken) and potential science (research we either haven't done but could or research we will only have the means to do in the future) with equal merit.

Back to McDonald's.

Following our example, if I asked if eating a McDonald's takeaway (of specified caloric value and chemical makeup), providing the context of my diet and genetics and so on, would make me put on weight in the form of stored fat, it's reasonable to say that it's within the reach of science to answer that question. We either already have, or could obtain, the data to answer conclusively, yes or no. And we can reframe 'if I eat at McDonald's, I will gain weight' to fit into the context of the question by adding the modal verb 'should', as we discussed before. Therefore: 'If I want to maintain my weight, I should not eat at McDonald's'.
	
As demonstrated, 'science' has told me how I should act in that situation. As such, when I supply an objective and obtain enough data, then yes, science can tell me how to live.

## Part 2

You might argue that such a statement can't be concluded from a single handpicked example. And you're right. I specifically chose an example which involved an easily quantifiable value – whether the numerical value of fat in my body would increase after regular McDonald's consumption, or whether my daily processes would be sufficient to burn those calories off after each meal. When the aims and objectives we have – to pass a test with a certain score, to achieve an income above a certain value – the metric for success is black and white. It's in these cases that science can tell us how we should live with total certainty. 
	
This includes cases that aren't so obviously numerical. If my objective is for a ball in my hand to bounce, I can quantify this as whether the height of the ball post-bounce is of similar height to pre-bounce, at which point we can conclude that the ball 'bounced' (success). Any height lower than that, we can define as the ball having 'dropped' (failure). In this way, most isolated examples can be quantified, and by extension, used in a scientific context.
	
Let's try, 'What should my favourite colour be?'. You might instinctively consider this to be a subjective and personal question, but I would argue that it too can be quantified. Current research suggests that the human eye perceives around a million different colours (since we have 3 types of cone cells each perceiving 100 shades) [3]. Let's give each colour a score from -100 to +100 based on how strongly my brain reacts to seeing that colour. For this, we can use a machine that detects levels of electrical activity in the brain. 
	
Since there are a finite number of colours, it's reasonable to assume that there will be a single colour, i.e. aquamarine, that reaches something like +99.82, beating out bright orange at +99.81, making it objectively my favourite colour. (There will be colours lower down with identical values, like a bell curve).
	
There are two ways to interpret this information. It's true that, with a microscopic enough scale and the supremely rigorous scientific method, every example can be made into a quantifiable measure of success or failure. With the example of colour, a common objection is that there are an infinite number of colours, and so there should be a smaller subset of infinite colours all scoring +100, at which point science can't give me a single highest scoring colour; the scientific method has fallen short. But this objection fails because the human eye can only perceive a finite number of shades. The fact that our experiences are limited by our body means that at some point, all data is discrete data with a high enough resolution. 
	
But the second conclusion that I draw is more cautious. It reiterates that the assumption I took in the beginning that 'science' refers to both existing and hypothetical data is simply an assumption. While it's interesting to think that, at some level, science really could tell us how we should act in every isolated situation, the question asks 'Can science…?', not 'Will…?' or 'Could science…?'. As with every generation, our science of today is limited, so when we disregard the potential of the scientific method, there are cases where contemporary science just can't tell us how we should live. Moreover, just like how we used to believe that the universe was geocentric [4] or that cigarettes were beneficial to our health [5], there are cases today where we as a scientific community are wrong and don't know it yet. To me, this produces a more thought-provoking conclusion: for many of us, science does indeed inform the way we live, even when it is wrong.

## Part 3

Things have been looking pretty favourable for science so far – it appears that in short, the answer to our question is simply 'yes; see terms and conditions'. And that's been true so far. And yet, hopefully, by the end of the essay, you'll begin to see the answer as a spectrum of many answers.
	
Firstly, some clarity is required on what an 'isolated example' really is. I've used the term now and then to break down how we should 'live' into how we should 'act in this situation'. As I said, it's easier to grapple with. Specifically, I use it to refer to all of the actions that are taken to achieve a single objective. When my single objective was to ascertain my favourite colour, I undertook a series of actions, all of which I consider to be part of one isolated example.
	
The difficulty comes when trying to ground these situations back into reality; going back from individual examples to 'living' as a whole. The difference is that when I have a singular objective in mind, there are a finite number of ways to achieve it, of which there is a single 'best' way to do so, i.e. most efficient and effective. I briefly mentioned an example of achieving above a certain score on a test. Either through existing scientific evidence [6] or by conducting new experiments and evaluating the data, we can determine the single most effective set of actions to take to achieve a particular score. Simultaneously, if I have responsibilities as a single parent to keep my child emotionally and physically healthy, given the nature of her genetics and lifestyle, and so on, there are a finite number of 'best' ways to achieve that, too. 
	
But what happens when I try to achieve them at the same time? Within the space of a day, let alone a year or a lifetime, each of us has hundreds of major to minute priorities that overlap simply by coexisting in my life at the same time. And the more objectives I have, the more potential outcomes there are that day for how things eventually turn out. Since I can't complete every objective to the same degree, the varying degrees of moderation to which I can achieve each task gives rise to an infinite number of possible outcomes, of which some are better than others. However, just like how increasing the number of colours I could choose from means that there will eventually be multiple colours that are equally scoring, there will necessarily be multiple 'best case' outcomes that just happen to prioritise different objectives over others.

See, to say I should do something (to achieve an objective) implies that there is a single best way to go about it. If there are many equally viable actions I could take, there is no scientific imperative to choose one of them over the other, and as such, no single action I 'should' take. As such, the more equally viable actions that arise, the lesser the role of science is in determining which I should choose.

This is why I think that our answer should be a spectrum rather than a clear yes or no answer. The fewer objectives we have at once, the greater the likelihood that there is one single best compromise that most effectively utilises our resources in achieving as many objectives to the greatest degree. However, as we juggle more and more objectives, the likelihood that there's more than one 'optimum' course of action determined by a scientific method increases. Simply put, the more colours we have to choose from, the greater the chance that ten, twelve or a thousand of them will all score 99.99. And out of that group, there's just no scientific method to choose the best colour; the utility of science decreases as the number of objectives you have increases. 

After all, to quote The Cincinnati Enquirer, 'The saying 'Life is just one damn thing after another,' is a gross understatement. The damn things overlap.'. Unfortunately, the more damn things you have, the less that science can help.
