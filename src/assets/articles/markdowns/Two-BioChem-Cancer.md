Synthetic biology is a topic that has recently been circulating in the news, from Israeli researchers 3D bioprinting a small heart out of human cells in 2019 [1], to the development of self-replicating xenobots from frog embryonic stem cells in 2021 [2]. The field involves the designing and redesigning of biological systems to make 'biological machines' that would otherwise not exist in nature. With the futuristic nature of this field, it is no wonder that these technologies have now also made their way into treatments for cancer, a disease with an estimated 19.3 million new cases in 2020 [3].

One new synthetic approach to treatment as an alternative to bone marrow transplants for blood cancers is CAR-T cell therapy. With bone marrow transplants, patients are given chemo/radiotherapy to weaken their bone structure and destroy unhealthy blood cells, after which they are given bone marrow stem cells from a healthy donor, resulting in the complete replacement of the blood and immune system. This procedure can be lifesaving as a weapon against blood cancers.

However, there are some disadvantages to bone marrow transplant treatments. Infection is an early danger, and some patients may develop veno-occlusive disease (a severe disease of the liver) due to the radiation. The risk of anaemia and excessive bleeding is increased due to the patient’s lack of red blood cells and platelets, meaning that they will require regular blood transfusions. The ultimate risk is the potential for the recipient's immune system to reject the 'foreign' marrow [4].

The immune system tells apart normal cells and pathogens and destroys many pathogens effectively. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell with two subtypes that play vital roles in the adaptive immune response; T cells that detect foreign antigens and release toxic chemicals to destroy pathogens, and B cells that produce antibodies that bind to pathogens or foreign substances to neutralise them, as well as recruit other cells to help destroy an infected cell. It is this cell that becomes malignant in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and diffuse large B cell lymphoma.

Cancer cells caused by mutations in somatic cells have a high chance of being undetected due to being the body’s own tissue. The aim of CAR-T cell therapy is to improve the T cells’ ability to recognise and kill a cancer cell and replicate themselves afterwards. This is made possible by reprogramming the patient’s immune system so that it can recognise the otherwise untraceable specific antigens on the cancer cells.

After a patient has passed the screening process, millions of the patient's T cells are extracted by an apheresis machine that removes T cells and recycles the blood back into the patient. A computer is then used to model a new written sequence of bases, which are built physically on a DNA printer. The new code programmes the T cells to modify antibodies to fit onto target antigens on the specific cancer. The result of all this re-coding is that the T cells now have chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) attached to them, which bring together the functions of both a T and B cell into a single unit.

The identification function of the chimaera cell is taken from the variable region of the B cell receptor, and the ability of the chimaera to destroy the cancer is brought from the T cell receptor CD3. However, T cells require more than just the CD3 marker for their attack function; co-stimulatory molecules such as CD28 are needed alongside them so that they can be activated in a way that doesn’t trigger autoimmune responses that would occur if they were activated all the time. The co-stimulatory molecules ensure that the T cells are only activated at specific points in time. Putting these variable regions together on the patient’s T cell leads to the formation of the CAR-T cell; the CD19 B cell markers on the outside of the cell surface membrane connected to the CD28 co-stimulatory molecule and CD3 T cell apparatus on the inside of the cell. The CAR-T cells can now target the otherwise invisible anti-CD19 antigens on cancer cells.

To introduce this DNA into the patient's T cells, a vector is used that infects the T cell and carries the new and improved DNA with it, such as an inactivated virus. The patient is given a mild dose of chemotherapy to wipe out existing T cells and stop the CAR-T cell response from being dampened. The CAR-T cells are then reinserted into the bloodstream, ready to find and kill cancerous cells.

Before CAR-T cell therapy, the survival rate of newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients was 38% and the survival rate five years after relapse was 7% [5], whilst diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) had a 2-year survival rate of 20% and a median survival of 6.3 months with salvage therapy [6], showing the unmet need for treatment for both cancers. After the development and use of CAR-T cell therapy as a clinical treatment, a 90% complete remission rate of ALL was recorded [7] and an overall event-free survival of 73% at 6 months and 50% at 12 months [8], as well as DLBCL complete remission rates of 43–58% and a 52% survival rate at a median follow-up of 15.4 months [9], showing the great significance of this breakthrough in blood cancer treatment.
 
Whilst CAR-T cell therapy seems to be a promising development that covers previous inadequacies in cancer treatment, a few limitations still exist. One issue is the need for high doses of chemotherapy or radiotherapy to kill malignant cells to ensure the best response to the procedure. This affects healthy tissues in the process and has side effects such as exhaustion, nausea, and vomiting. Another problem is that this treatment is only effective in treating blood malignancies since the CAR-T cells cannot infiltrate the physical barriers or survive within the immunosuppressive environment inside solid tumours. The most challenging limitation of CAR-T cell therapy is the development of tumour resistance to the single target antigen receptor on the newly engineered cell; this is known as antigen escape. While single antigen-targeting CAR-T cells, such as CD19-targeted CAR-T cells, can initially produce high response rates, the cancer cells of a large proportion of patients who receive this treatment exhibit partial to complete loss of target antigen expression. Though 70–90% of relapsed ALL patients respond to CD19 targeted CAR-T cell therapy, eventually resistance arises, with a loss of the CD19 antigen in 30–70% of relapsed patients [10].
 
The solution to these problems with CAR-T cell therapy may be given by a different cancer treatment; that is, re-coding bacteria to deliver drugs to solid tumours in the patient. While CAR-T cells need sophisticated engineering to find and infiltrate solid tumours, the inside of solid tumours provides the ideal immunity-deprived microenvironment for bacteria like E. coli, in which they can multiply and grow, then target the tumour from the inside. Besides this, this treatment is much more flexible than other cancer therapies since bacteria do not target a specific cancer type, only the conditions found commonly within cancerous tumours.

The relevant gene sequences are inserted into the bacteria, much like how they are inserted into CAR-T cells, to give them the ability to synthesise different compounds from what they typically produce; molecules that can inhibit the growth of cancer. In addition, the bacteria can be programmed with various behaviours depending on the presence, absence, or combination of certain conditions using biological circuits. The response does not needlessly impact healthy tissues, unlike chemotherapy and radiation given to patients before bone marrow transplants and CAR-T cell therapy, since the bacteria can identify and target the anaerobic environments and low pH levels that are only characteristic of tumour cells.

A synchronised lysis circuit (SLC) further enhances the bacteria’s new features. Not only can the bacteria be scheduled to only begin production of anti-cancer drugs within the tumour to avoid the harming of healthy cells, once the drugs have been produced and the bacteria number has reached a certain value, the bacteria undergo apoptosis, allowing the drugs to be released and the bacteria population to decrease to a specific percentage. This remaining portion of bacteria is left to reproduce and regrow the colony to repeat the cycle. The circuit can be reconfigured to set the bacterial lysis timers to whatever schedule will be most effective in destroying the tumour.

Although this medication is still in its early phases of development, it has already proved successful in eliminating lymphoma tumours in mice, as well as activating the immune system to fight untreated malignant tumours in other regions of the mouse's body.

Even more recently, the two cell therapies can be merged to form probiotic-guided CAR-T cells (ProCARS), where T cells are genetically engineered to be able to recognise and react to synthetic antigens periodically released by the modified bacteria residing inside the cancerous tumours. Bringing the two treatments together draws the antigen-independence of the bacteria and the sensing abilities of the CAR-T cells together to produce a combined cell therapy solid tumour targeting that can be used for all cancer types [11].

These new advances in the field of synthetic biology have opened the door to the potential development of individualised and adaptable cancer treatments that go beyond the limitations of singular therapies, all driven by genetically redesigned CAR-T and probiotic bacterial cell research.
