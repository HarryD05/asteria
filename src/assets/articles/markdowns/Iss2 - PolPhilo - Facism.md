## Defining Fascism

As understood by sociologist Michael Mann, fascism comes in two types, the ideological and the practical, yet what unites the two is a common focus on statism through nationalism and economic equalization. That is, fascists try to solve problems stemming from economic inequalities and ethnic divisions by placing the nation-state above the individual while evening the economic playing field for those who ardently identify with them. At the same time, those who do not share the same level of approval for fascism become the “enemy” or “opposition.” Unsurprisingly, fascists work to debase the claims of their “enemies” through political attacks, conspiracy theories, charges of disloyalty, and physical violence.

To fascists, the ideological significance of violence is an important part of who they are since they understand themselves to be at “war” with mainstream governments.5 Consequently, by joining with like-minded individuals, and forming subcultural groups which usually feature militaristic ranks, fascists attempt to embody their “battle” with the status-quo through comradery. Lastly, fascism, as a counter-cultural belief system, necessarily needs an ideological “opposition” to thrive, because without an “enemy” there would be no “war” to wage.

To Mann, Fascists – though usually highly-educated, idealistic, and fervent in their political views – nevertheless believe violence is a moral and efficient way to solve divisions in society. To fascists, it is the right of the nation-state to combat its “enemies,” to maintain its national character. In other words, fascists believe the nation-state should be homogenous, so the cultural aspects defining it remain untainted, even if it calls for physical force.

### Fascists claim that statism is the surest way to eradicate economic disparities in society. This ultimately leads to fascism’s goal of global totalitarian corporate bodies, vying for economic dominance.

Furthermore, fascists claim statism is the surest way to eradicate economic disparities in society. That is, the economic vision associated with fascism is unionization of the masses which would organically form a corporate entity or the state. To fascists, the surest way to achieve this financial arrangement is a blend of nationalism, to unite people and socialism to syndicate labor. Accordingly, this would lead to fascism’s goal of a nation where there is no interstate competition, but rather global totalitarian corporate bodies, vying for economic dominance.

Obedience is central to fascist economic projects since it is when everyone plays his or her part for the benefit of the nation-state that it can take on other national economies. Accordingly, violence used against those who do not comply with fascists economic fantasies is moral since individuality is incompatible with obedience, and threatens the unity of the nation.To avoid disobedience, it is not uncommon for fascists leaders to prey on the masses through populist promises, and excessive praise of the “successes” of the nation.

Moreover, absolute submission to the nation-state is paramount to fascist financial schemes since to dominate the world economically all laborers must work as one. In other words, fascists believe only cohesive labor forces can challenge the economies of other states since their oneness gels with the transcendent unity of the nation. Consequently, unquestioning and unwavering dedication to one’s workforce is crucial because without it economic inequality within the nation could emerge, stopping it from being a state in the fascist's sense. Lastly, through a fascist lens, ferocity against those who do not labor for the benefit of the nation-state is permissible since they jeopardize its economic mission.
