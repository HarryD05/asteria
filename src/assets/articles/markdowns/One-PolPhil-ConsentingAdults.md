## I. Authentic Consent & The Problem of Consent to Harm
Before considering how consent functions in moral cases, it must first be articulated what consent actually is. Basically conceived, consent is “an act of permitting something to be done or of recognizing some authority”[1].

In limiting our question to concern of consenting acts involving adults though, we tacitly recognise some limits on consent differentiating it from mere assent. We rightly restrict children to being incapable of consent; in On Liberty, Mill writes that personal sovereignty (and therefore consent) is the preserve only of “human beings in maturity of their faculties”[2]. By the same principle, we might similarly deem those with severe mental health conditions to be incapable of consent[3], or those whose faculties are only temporarily impaired, for example, if they are drunk. Clearly, there is some threshold of freedom and rationality before which an agent’s consent is inauthentic.

Mill justifies that it is right to restrict someone’s capacity of consent in cases where they “must be protected against their own actions”, implying that, upon the recognition that consent is at least intended as a moral sanction for action, there is a need to avoid sanctioning damage resulting from some irrational agent to their own harm[4].

Such an analysis immediately brings into question though whether an adult – specifically one who we would normally consider to be free and rational – can be deprived of consent on the same basis as children though, given that generally rational adults often do consent to their own harm. This problem will form the basis of the objections discussed in this essay whereby the view that consent is capable of absolving wrongdoing may be rejected - the problem that substantially rational adults are demonstrably capable of consenting harms (or at least to minor harms) to themselves.

There are certain cases, such as rape, in which the harm involved is itself dependent on consent, and which consent would substantially transform or annul[5]. However, there is a majority of harms a person might consent to (for example, consenting to being hit) in which consent does nothing to alleviate the harm experienced in the act. At least according to a pointedly consequentialist view of ethics then, there is a justified default position here that consent does necessarily hold any moral significance. Acts involving only consenting adults may be morally wrong under the same conditions as any other act – the condition that they incur more moral harm than good.

To argue the contrary – that consent can annul moral harm – we require some more general principle of liberty, which defends a fundamental right for someone to act upon her own consent, and allow others to do the same to her also upon her consent; where she can decide which ethical duties apply to her. 

## II. The Harm Principle
Mill presents this kind of right in his ‘Harm Principle’, which states that “the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant.”[7]. This principle, at first, seems to arise in respect of a fundamental concept of personal liberty, about which Mill writes “In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign”[8].

As personal liberty entails that our sole moral limit is in acting upon other people, consent is defended as absolute, and annulling culpability for moral harm, both in the case of harming one’s self, and in the case where one devolves their allowance to harm themselves to another in accordance with their “free, voluntary, and undeceived consent and participation”[9].

There is a problematic sense though, in which the Harm Principle is both a fundamental expression of liberty, and simultaneously not about liberty at all. Mill’s real justification for the absolute moral legitimacy of consent is not on the basis any “abstract” libertarian right, but rather given a utilitarian slant which makes liberty merely instrumental in achieving wider utilitarian ends (principally avoiding governmental tyranny). Regardless of whether the Harm Principle is justified as a political right – where politics may be taken as ethics in the context of society as a whole - there is a clear disconnect between such ideas and the purely ethical realm. From Mill’s own consequentialist perspective, it is still the case that action between consenting agents may be wrong, provided that it is sufficiently isolated from wider society, and therefore Mill does not actually defend the moral impunity involved in acts of consent on an absolute basis.

## III. Kantian Liberty – the Sovereignty Principle
At the core of this tension whereby the Harm Principle functions best for political but not ethical legislation is also Mill’s “negative” concept of liberty – a concept of liberty as deriving from the absence of external limits on a person’s individual powers[10]. While there is a strong case that freedom (and the value of consent) must be defended from external limits in any concept of liberty, the concept fails unless this is done on the basis of a positive libertarian axiom, not just under the threat of the tyranny brought about by abandoning liberty, as Mill expresses. This negative basis ultimately dissolves into a fundamentally anti-libertarian, consequentialist ethical system. To form a coherent basis for universally justifying consent, liberty as such must manifest as both a fundamental political and an ethical concept.

It is also through this inconsistent relationship with liberty that the Harm Principle, intending to justify the “wrongless harms” involved when someone consents to their harm, becomes vulnerable the problem of “harmless wrongs.” In “Beyond the Harm Principle”, Arthur Ripstein’s argument against Mill is structured around the example of a person who invades someone’s home and takes a nap there, without damaging the home or tangibly setting back the owner’s interests in anyway[11] . In this case, there clearly is some principled moral wrong involved, associated with a violation of the homeowner’s liberty without consent. However, the Harm Principle fails to legislate against this on account of its utilitarian basis: it must hold that there is no harm to the homeowner, so there is no wrong. Generally, the Harm Principle suffers on account of being incapable of prohibiting any violation, so long as it does not actually manifest in harm.

In recognition that avoidance of harm cannot be an exclusive basis for wrongdoing, Ripstein exchanges a utilitarian justification for liberty with a Kantian one, in which freedom is grounded in the inherent dignity of the human as an end-in-itself[12].From this he derives the “Sovereignty Principle”, which states that “The only legitimate restrictions on conduct are those that secure mutual independence of free persons from each other”[13]. Through this principle, harmless wrongs such as the home-invasion are successfully prohibited on the basis that the wrongdoer has placed the victim (or, in this case, the victim’s property, over which they are also sovereign) as a mere means, violating the independence and sovereignty of the victim. 

This “Sovereignty Principle” provides a much stronger basis for moral impunity in the case of consenting harm. An individual’s sovereignty entails that they can choose, via consent, which ethical duties apply to themselves. Therefore, whenever an agent consents to something done to them, what is done to them is in accordance with their choice and their interests, and therefore their dignity as ends-in-themselves, and their independence is never violated, regardless of the context of the specific harm which troubles Mill’s principle.

When they consent to their own harm, “any harm that ensues is not an interference with sovereignty. Other harms do interfere with sovereignty, but it is that interference, not their harmfulness, that merits prohibition”[14].

## IV. Consent in Violation of Human Dignity
While this concept that one’s dignity can never be infringed upon according to consent seems intuitively reasonable, there is an important objection in the case of particularly grave harms. This is not merely on the consequentialist basis articulated in the introduction to the essay, although it could be argued that the extent of the harms effected by certain consensual acts might be so great as to exceed the value of maintaining any principle of liberty. Instead, there may be cases in which some harm is so extreme as to infringe upon a consenting subject’s liberty, and further than this, their human dignity itself, purely by virtue of the gravity of the harm. 

Ripstein only entertains that freedom can be wrongly restricted, and human dignity degraded as the result of one actor enforcing their will upon another and the things over which they are sovereign. However, in “The Moral Limits of Consent as a Defense in the Criminal Law” Dennis Baker argues a harm like death can clearly destroy our human dignity in of itself to a far greater extent than anyone else’s decision to use us for their own ends, and it is because of this that consent is an unreasonable justification for murder[15].

In his articulation of the humanity principle, Kant himself explains that we are “not at liberty to dispose of that humanity which constitutes my person, either by killing, maiming, or mutilating it,” on the basis that even the subject of a harm is capable, in consenting to the harm, of treating herself as a mere means and thus, infringing upon their own sovereignty[16].

In response to this, Ripstein simply recognises that the Sovereignty Principle has “no resource to prohibit suicide, as it does not involve domination”, providing only an argument against consent to murder by an external agent[17]. However, both the problem of suicide and the problem of consent to one’s own murder are of equal significance from this Kantian perspective as, in moving from suicide to consenting murder, while the structure of culpability might be altered, it is still the same ultimate ethical rights and consequences which are at stake.

It is my view that Ripstein misses a significant objection to this though, which is that Kant and Baker, in arguing that an agent is capable of consenting to the degradation of their own dignity, misrepresent what constitutes authentic consent. Particularly, they do not rightly consider whether such agents satisfy the condition of rationality as established at the beginning of this essay. For example, Baker recognises that we have an inalienable right to life and yet he conceives of a rational agent could deny this right while maintaining the rationality needed to be capable of consent[18]. I believe it also more widely evident that, in any of the cases Kant presents – the desire to kill, maim, or mutilate one’s self – such desires are always the consequence of some mental disorder.

Obviously an agent’s requirement for rationality for consent is not absolute; there is irrationality which may be permissibly involved in any exercise of personal autonomy. But there is a central and dangerous irrationality necessary for them to degrade their own dignity involved when one treats one’s self as a mere means, forgoing any ethical duty to their own life, and general humanity, which certainly precludes them from consent.

Ultimately, if the purpose of consent is to represent one’s fundamental interests, and an agent’s interests fundamental are not being represented in the act they consent to (i.e. in one in which they treat themselves as a mere means), it is clear consent has been misattributed.

## V. Conclusion
In general then, while it has been shown there is a valid defence of consent as providing moral immunity via the positive, libertarian basis of the Sovereignty Principle, we must also recognise there is an extent to which this libertarian ideal restricts consent; it introduces a rational threshold through which we must pass to gain it. On the basis of the Sovereignty Principle then, we can conclude that the acts of consenting adults are never morally wrong, so long as we are aware that consent is held only on the condition that we do not abuse it in degrading our own dignity.
