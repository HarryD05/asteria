The mixed-race population is the fastest-growing ethnic minority in the world - 2.2% of the UK’s adults identified as such in 2011, compared to 1.4% in 2001 (when the option to register as a mixed race first became available in the UK).

## I. Social Attitudes to Multiracialism

To begin with, it is important to outline that multiracial individuals face a very unique form of discrimination, referred to as mixed erasure. This can be thought of as the racial equivalent of bisexual erasure - where the identities of individuals are ignored, removed, falsified or re-explained to fit a separate narrative in primary sources of media. The most extreme forms of this include the belief that multiracial people do not exist. For individuals who have white and non-white ancestry, this can be particularly distressing as their identities are continually debated - ‘you are not a person of colour’ is a common phrase used by surrounding peers. This in combination with labels such as ‘white-passing’, ‘part white’ and comments on ancestral percentages are argued by some to contribute to the monoracial lens of society – where you can only be one or the other. This can become alienating for individuals of white and non-white ancestry; in a world where you are defined by being either white or a person of colour, someone with ancestry in both labels can be made to feel excluded from both groups. As Ela Heeley (Turkish and Romani) put it, “the same equality movement designed to uplift marginalised voices has become the same movement that excludes anyone who doesn’t fit the role of the ‘model minority’.” Categorising people into predetermined boxes based on what they ‘pass’ as disregards parts of their heritage and identity.

But being mixed is not a recent development - author Heidi Durrow (Danish and African American) pointed out that there is, in fact, a "long, forgotten history of mixed-race people having achieved great things, but they had to choose one race over the other.” This started to change when Obama (white and Kenyan) began to talk about multiracialism on a mainstream platform – although he campaigned as a Black man, he began to pave the way for more multiracial individuals to feel represented. Despite this, America’s history of the ‘one-drop rule’ helped Durrow realise that there are compelling reasons for mixed-race people with Black ancestry to identify solely as Black. However, she also explains that she is “not interested in mixed-race identity in terms of percentages – I don’t feel like a lesser Dane or a lesser African American. I don’t want to feel like I’m a person made of pieces.” This contrasts the 61% of multiracial individuals in America who, in 2015, did not identify as multiracial at all.

In order to better understand why the existence of multiracial individuals is so controversial, it would be useful to have a brief outline of the socio-legal positions throughout modern history. The most relevant example is the progression of anti-miscegenation laws, particularly in America, which essentially barred people from different racial backgrounds from marrying; as a result, any children born of an interracial marriage would be illicit.

The first anti-miscegenation law in America was passed in 1664 under British Colonial rule, and
banned any marriage between white people and Black people, ordering that any white woman who
married a Black man was to become a slave too. Later, these laws extended to include relations
between Native Americans and white people. In 1883, the Supreme Court decided unanimously that
state-level bans on interracial marriage did not violate the 14th Amendment (which says that no
state can enforce a law that abridges any citizen’s privileges or immunities) - this ruling, decided in
Pace v. Alabama, held for more than eighty years. In 1922, the first wave of anti-Asian xenophobic
attitudes began to take hold in law; while previously anti-miscegenation laws had been targeted at
Black or Native American peoples, the Cable Act of 1922 stripped US citizenship from any white
woman who married an “alien ineligible for citizenship” - in context of the time, this referred primarily
to Asian people. Progress started to be made to reverse the above laws in 1964, but the Supreme
Court did not directly address the ban on interracial marriages until the unanimous ruling in the
historic Loving v. Virginia case of 1967, which declared that bans on interracial marriage violated the
14th Amendment. After this, interracial marriage became legal throughout the United States, with
Alabama becoming the last state to legalise it in 2000. But to this day, there remains a lot of
controversy in the Deep South about interracial marriage, with a 2011 poll showing that many
Republicans in Mississippi still support anti-miscegenation laws. This notion of racial purity is partly
what leads to the exclusion of mixed-race individuals from families and communities. As Black Minds
Matter founder Agnes Mwakatuma rightfully pointed out, mixed people “may not feel that they
belong to either end of the race spectrum, due to neglect from both parties.” In particular with
families, monoracial parents of multiracial individuals may not understand (and in some cases, refuse
to believe) the experiences of their mixed children, because the discrimination that multiracial people
face is so unique from any other type. This can create alienation and distancing within households,
and young people may feel isolated within their own homes.

Knowing the history of where terminology came from can help us to unpack why views on interracial
marriages and multiracial children are so varied and controversial. During the start of the American
Civil War, the term ‘amalgamation’ was used to refer to multiracial individuals, before ‘miscegenation’
appeared in 1863, mostly used by abolitionists who encouraged interracial procreation. This was
initially published in a hoax pamphlet in order to get Lincoln re-elected, with the promise of solving
America’s ‘race problem’ - the term ‘miscegenation’ outlived Lincoln and changed, with
anti-miscegenation laws becoming the foundational justification for the Jim Crow era of segregation.
Race studies scholar Philip Kadish noted that “the term ‘miscegenation’ has the same prefix as
‘mistake’ and ‘misbegotten’, planting the notion that races represent different species and should be
separated.”

But terms are ever-changing. All over the world there have been an array of words used to describe
multiracial people, from ‘di colore’ (of colour) in early Rome, to ‘hafu’ and ‘daburu’ (half and double
respectively) in Japan. In 1937, sociologist Everett Stonequist referred to mixed-race people as
“marginal men”. Some multiracial people view the word ‘mixed’ as dehumanising and offensive,
preferring ‘multiracial’. Others view ‘mixed’ as completely normal, and refer to themselves as such.
Terms such as ‘biracial’ are also commonly used, but are too limiting in their nature. The apparent
need for increased linguistic fluidity is not unusual - activist Andrew Jovilette says that we should
“ask people what they prefer, because we all have different experiences… we shouldn’t create
universal truths for everybody, because everybody has different experiences, even if we’re the same
mix.” Differences in experiences are key to understanding and recognising that there is no blanket
term to cover all multiracial individuals - and nor should there be.

Additionally, the way we are perceived plays a significant role in shaping multiracial people’s
identities. Those who are perceived to be white-passing or white-adjacent are treated to be white,
which means that yes, we do benefit from white privilege. One potentially positive outcome of this is
that we can use our position of privilege to raise issues of injustice, and navigate spaces that other
multiracial individuals may not be able to. This privilege does not disregard the lived experiences of
injustice and discrimination that we face as mixed people, but it does give us the opportunity to be
able to “come out” with our ancestry and identity, which individuals who are perceived to be people
of colour do not have the option for - they are typecast and stereotyped based on their outward
appearances, just like white-passing people, but face additional prejudices that a white-passing
person may not.

On the other end of the spectrum, there also seems to be an odd fascination with the appearance of
mixed-race people. Comments such as “that’s/you’re so hot!”, ”mixed people are always so much
more attractive”, "that's/you're so exotic", “mixed babies are soooo cute!” and “I’d have a baby with a
person from [xyz ethnic group] so they could look like you” are all examples of fetishisation of
multiracial individuals - which is not only uncomfortable to be on the receiving end of, but also quite
disturbing and dehumanising as general statements. On the surface, this appears to convey
acceptance of mixed people, but in actuality it only values mixed people for the outward appearance
and stereotypes us all as immediately attractive only because we're mixed. Exoticisation (a
manifestation of white supremacy designating something as “other” but nonthreatening) identifies
“familiar” and “foreign” features in mixed people, which further fetishises their so-called “exotic”
features. This, in and of itself, disregards our struggles to fit in a society that assumes monoracialism - it also communicates that mixed-race babies are only born for the purposes of being cute or
attractive. Degrading and disregarding the identities and lives of multiracial individuals, even when
you think you’re saying something harmless, can have lasting effects on the person being spoken to.

## II. Impacts on Mental Health
Unsurprisingly, all of the above can have a huge impact on the mental health of multiracial
individuals. Imposter syndrome is a common experience among mixed people, and it goes beyond
affecting our own impressions of knowledge or skills - it affects how we view our own cultural
identities, and what we feel we are (and subsequently are not) allowed to be. This can create a
disconnect between the individual and their ancestry, whether in the mind or in practice, and can
mean that multiracial individuals feel like racial imposters, with little or no right to their own cultural
identities. The fear of accusation of ethnic fishing can cause some multiracial individuals to feel as
though they ought to prohibit themselves from taking part in cultural events, or wear cultural clothes
and symbols. Cultural appropriation is a very real phenomena, and is rightfully condemned; however,
a knock-on effect of this is that multiracial individuals who feel like racial imposters might feel as
though they have little or no right to their own ancestry and can begin to feel fragmented and
separated from all of their background - the notion of being “too much” of one and “not enough” of
another is a common thought process, especially among those who “pass” as one above another and
don’t speak all of the languages their relatives do.

There are a multitude of reasons why individuals feel disconnected from their culture and ancestry -
ranging from geographical, language and cultural barriers to wider societal issues such as racism and
colourism. Colourism and a lack of proper representation in the media perpetuates the social isolation
and exclusion that multiracial individuals face - examples include how lighter skin is seen to be more
desirable among people of colour and mixed people, perpetuating and upholding the ‘proximity to
whiteness’ standard. In fact, since the 1930s, Brazil has welcomed European immigrants and
encouraged interracial marriage between them and Brazilian citizens, while Chinese and African
immigrants were barred, in order for the European immigrants, to help “whiten” the population. There
is also a seeming trend to cast monoracial people as canonically multiracial characters - for example,
Lana Condor (Vietnamese) was cast as Lara Jean Covey (who is canonically white and Korean) in To
All The Boys I’ve Loved Before. This works the other way around too - Henry Golding (white and
Malay) was cast as Nick Young (canonically Singaporean Chinese) in Crazy Rich Asians. There are
very few characters and actors in the media who properly represent multiracial individuals, which can
mean that mixed-race individuals don’t feel heard, or don’t have role models who look like them. This
can have a significant impact on mental health - from feeling alienated in social settings, and even
sometimes feeling as though we don’t fit into our own skin, with conflicts in our own identities as the
multiple cultures and ideologies clash.

Imposter syndrome is not the only mental health effect that societal views and pressures can have on
multiracial individuals. According to Mental Health America, multiracial individuals are the most likely
to “screen positive or at-risk for alcohol/substance use disorders, anxiety, depression, eating
disorders, and psychosis”, with a particular trend in susception to depression and anxiety. Even
though compared to white people in America, mixed-race individuals statistically have higher rates of
poor mental health conditions, there are less protective factors in place for them to seek help. Similar
to how Black people are disproportionately represented in hospitals and prisons compared to white
people, a December 2021 study carried out by Nuffield Trust in the UK showed that multiracial
individuals made up around 4% of the restricted patients in hospitals, despite only contributing to
around 2% of the UK’s total population.

It seems to be a given that certainly some multiracial individuals will suffer from negative mental
health conditions as a result of the way society is structured. But it may not be so obvious that
despite the challenges we face, there have been shown to be some benefits to growing up in a
multicultural environment. Some of these include, but are not limited to, higher levels of empathy,
tolerance, open-mindedness, creativity and appreciation of others. These could be, in part, due to the
challenges multiracial individuals have faced. It can also be easier to have more diverse friendship
groups, finding communities of people both online and offline where the commonality of the
“multiracial experience” brings people together. On top of this, a greater ability to connect with more
people due to increased cultural experiences/awareness can mean that multiracial individuals can
relate to their monoracial peers too, on a cultural level, because they may have similar experiences if
they have taken part in particular festivals, for example.

## III. Multiracialism and Medicine
It has been highlighted recently that there is a significant lack of research into how different
medicines and health conditions can affect people of colour. There is one particular drug that caused
some debate - BiDil is a race-based heart medicine, targeted and marketed to improve Black people’s
symptoms with heart-related issues - so how does this impact multiracial people? Because there is a
lack of widespread understanding on how genetics works, when mixed-race people of Black ancestry
see medicine marketed at Black people, the first question asked is “How will this affect me?”
Concerns include whether it will only partially work, whether it will work at all, and why it has been
marketed that way to begin with. This has called into question whether the concept of race is a social
construct, or whether there is actually any scientific evidence behind it. An article published on the
National Library of Medicine in 2006 claims that race is a purely social construct, as the “latest
genomic science has failed to provide much support for our intuitions about racial categories in
medicine”, further clarifying that there is no real basis in the genetic coding for race because there can
be “more genetic diversity within a so-called “racial” cohort than there is difference between two
such cohorts”. Despite this, it is noted that eliminating race from medicine would be equally
impractical, because people of colour are often subject to stressful and traumatic situations due to
the colour of their skin, which can have an impact on their physical health.

However, there are some clear examples of how race can impact medicine. In the case of leukaemia
patients of mixed race, it can be especially difficult to reconcile that they may have a significantly
smaller chance of recovering than monoracial patients, particularly white patients. The treatment
involves stem cells being collected from the bone marrow, but there is a catch - the donor and the
recipient have to be a genetic match. It is more likely that matches are found among strangers of the
same ancestral background than within families - which means that white people have the highest
chance (77%) of finding a donor because they make up the majority of the donor list. In 2019, only
3% of the world’s donors were mixed race - but even fewer are statistically going to be an exact
match to the patient. According to Professor Hermann Einsele, “two different populations” (for
example, Chinese and Central European) “have different markers (to white donors) which makes
procedures between different ethnic groups difficult”, especially when the patient has markers
belonging to more than one population (i.e. they are mixed-race). Due to the lack of donors available,
families of multiracial patients sometimes have no choice but to advertise and campaign for people to
offer to donate - for example, ABC Eyewitness News in 2017 published an advertising article in late
2019 on behalf of the family of a seven-year-old boy who needed a transplant, but could not find a
donor. Even though the child had been treated using his brother’s bone marrow to begin with, the
cancer returned, which meant that the family had no choice but to look elsewhere for donors.

## IV. To Conclude
In summary, it is fairly self-evident that every single mixed-race person’s experiences are unique -
there are often points of overlap, perhaps with fetishising comments or imposter syndrome, but the
“multiracial experience” is individual to everyone. This means that the title is perhaps a little
misleading - there is not one set way to “be mixed” so everybody’s views are going to differ based on
their own lived experiences. There is a difference for some people between their ancestry and their
own identities - we are not a monolithic group, and nor should we be treated as such. Even among
siblings of the same mix, their experiences may differ. While the negative impacts of being
mixed-race can be upsetting to individuals, being mixed is not the issue at hand and it is not
inherently bad for you - it is the views and attitudes of the people and societies around us that cause
us to feel as though we do not belong. The controversy surrounding who we are as people is in itself
controversial, when really it shouldn’t be - we are human beings, just like everyone else. With the
rise of multiracialism, we are seeing that the need to label and categorise everything as one or
another is changing - perhaps this will challenge society’s apparent need for binaries, and allow for
greater acceptance of fluidity and personal choice in identification in the future.
