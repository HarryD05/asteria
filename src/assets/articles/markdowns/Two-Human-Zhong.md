## Three Yuans

We don’t know exactly when Yuan Shu was born, but it would have been sometime around Cao Cao’s birth in 155. Supposedly fated by the heavens whilst in Lady Feng’s womb, Yuan Shu was youngest son of the _Minister of Works_ Yuan Feng. By the time of Yuan Shu’s birth, the Yuan Clan of Runan had become one of the most powerful families in Eastern Han China, following their _Four Generations of Three Grand Excellences_, when both his uncle and father served at the court of Emperor Zhang. However, fortunes had seemingly been bestowed onto the second born son, Yuan Ji, since the eldest, Yuan Shao, was born from a maid and considered unworthy. Yuan Ji was raised strictly and expected to inherit Yuan Feng’s titles. As a result; the young Yuan Shu was free to do as he wished when he was younger and spent most of his time hunting with other young masters using companions of eagles and dogs— like some kind of Disney prince.

However, as he grew older his ambition drove him to a more scholarly life in order to pursue a political career. He even forgoed  time at the hunting grounds to spend longer hours at home in order to embody the filial piety of the Han, a necessity of character in order to receive a recommendation letter for Government positions. Given the illustrious record and prestige of his family the recommendation letter did come and, with almost prophetic coincidence and immense privilege, Yuan Shu graduated from the local government as the Administrator of Henan - the exact title that the great Yuan An, founder of the Yuan clan, had held for 10 years. Yuan Shu then quickly received the title Colonel of the Rapid Tiger Guards, a retinue of light cavalry that guarded the imperial palace from external and internal threats. The Tiger Guards were also one of the only cavalry units in the capital, Luoyang; this in combination with his family's name made Yuan Shu an attractive ally for those at Emperor Liu Hong’s court. 

## The Ten Attendants and He Jin

In the later years of Liu Hong’s reign tension had been boiling between the eunuch faction and Grand General He Jin. Declared Emperor as a child, Liu Hong was raised by the eunuchs and became close to a eunuch named Zhang Rang in particular. Named The Ten Attendants, the eunuch faction began to increase its power in court through its close ties to the Emperor. In 188, the eunuchs even obtained their own militia when one of their faction members, Jian Shuo, was appointed as a colonel of the Army of the Western Garden. The original purpose of the Army of the Western Garden was to prevent He Jin from securing all the military power in Luoyang. Of course this worked effectively until Liu Hong’s sudden death in the winter of 189. His death was so sudden that Liu Hong had not formally named a successor between his two sons. Empress He and He Jin both supported the elder brother, Liu Bian, in the succession as it followed tradition. On the contrary, The Ten Attendants supported the younger brother Liu Xie since he would be easier to exploit in the manner that they did with his father. Between the Jian Shuo’s eunuch faction and He Jin, Yuan Shu picked He Jin for a variety of reasons:

-	Firstly, as a member of the social elite, Yuan Shu believed that the eunuchs were subhuman and an unnatural blemish on the Han Dynasty. 
-	Secondly, siding with Empress He could play to his advantage in the future as it could help him gain enough favour in the Imperial Court for another promotion.
-	Thirdly, He Jin held many military connections and had a similar career path whom the young Yuan Shu could potentially learn a lot from.

For these reasons it made sense for Yuan Shu to naturally commit to He Jin’s cause who had also attracted the talents of eldest brother Yuan Shao. Despite being in favour of Liu Xie,  the eunuchs had no conventional standing as officials in court which meant an even greater lack of voice on matters of succession. Under these circumstances, they decided on a more blunt force strategy and began to plot the assassination of Liu Bian which also meant the assassination of his protector, He Jin. The story, which ought to be told in detail, then goes that Jian Shuo forged a letter to Empress He, asking for He Jin’s assistance and presence at the palace at which point he would be murdered. Unfortunately, Jian Shuo was intercepted by an old servant of He Jin, who fled the capital. Once safe, He Jin arrested and executed Jian Shuo. He Jin then secured all the military power available by absorbing Yuan Shao’s, another Colonel of the Army of the Western Garden, forces. Thus the Army of the Western Garden had dissolved and no one in Luoyang could contest He Jin, leading to Liu Bian taking the throne.

    <em>The Ten Attendants</em>
</div>


New opposition to the He clan would take form in Empress Dowager Dong and her nephew, Dong Chong who accused the Hes of using the death of Emperor Liu Hong as an opportunity to purge the government in a power grab and using the new Emperor, Liu Bian, as a puppet. The two empresses argued for nights until Empress Dowager Dong shouted:

<div class="centre"><em>“You are powerful now because you rely on your brother! But I can order the General of Agile Cavalry to cut off He Jin's head, and that would be as easy as turning my hand!”</em></div>

Less than two weeks later, on the 11th June 189, Dong Zhong was arrested and imprisoned. Knowing that the prospect of freedom would require copious amounts of opium to event speak of, Dong Zhong committed suicide. Empress He wrote an imperial decree to banish Empress Dong to Hejian where her condition deteriorated after hearing of Dong Zhong’s death and she died shortly after in the same year. This would have arguably been a political victory for Empress He and He Jin except that both Dong Zhong and Empress Dowager Dong were adored by the public, leading to a drastic fall in the popularity of the He clan. Regardless, they still had a monopoly on violence and the public were unable to take action and things calmed down after a while. 

As Yuan Shao left Luoyang to pursue his own ambitions he placed Zhang Jin in his stead. Upon arrival Zhang Jin noted that the whole capital was blatantly corrupt and he notified He Jin who determined the source of the corruption to be the eunuchs. And thus the plan came about to exterminate The Ten Attendants and funnily enough Yuan Shao came back when he heard about the plan. Empress He wasn’t convinced that such a measure would be necessary so the three considered bringing the tyrannical and feared Dong Zhuo to the capital in order to “convince” Empress He of the necessity to kill the eunuchs. Wary and fearful of the new anti-eunuch influence in the capital, the eunuchs tried to summon He Jin at the palace. Yuan Shao advised that the eunuchs ought to be killed as opposed to entering the palace. Wary of his unpopularity and the threat of rebellion, He Jin decided against and instead ordered Yuan Shao to lead an investigation on the claims against the eunuchs. Yuan Shu was then ordered by Yuan Shao to replace the palace guards who showed more loyalty to the eunuch faction than He Jin. Only once all of the following was accomplished would Empress He write an imperial decree calling for the eunuchs to be dispatched. Very cool but Zhang Rang overheard all of this so the eunuchs forged a letter to He Jin from the Empress, requesting his presence in the palace. Upon entering the palace He Jin was murdered and, not knowing that the Yuan brother’s were outside with every soldier and officer in Luoyang, the eunuchs threw his head over the wall in a final act of disrespect. Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu then stormed and set fire to the capital, killing any man without facial hair. Young men dropped their pants in order to prevent being killed and over 2000 eunuchs were killed, irrespective of their ties to The Ten Attendants. In the chaos, eunuch Duan Gui kidnapped Liu Bian and Liu Xie and fled the capital when he ran into Dong Zhuo’s army who took captive the brothers. The significance that this event plays in the development of the Yuan brother’s cannot be understated. They were both still very young and, despite being in positions of power and responsibility, held no real decision making power in neither their clan nor the imperial government. However, after Emperor Liu Hong and He Jin’s deaths, the two became prominent players in the politics of Eastern Han since they inherited He Jin’s monopoly on violence. This was hugely important as Yuan Shu stayed ambitious until his death. Upon Dong Zhou’s power grab, Yuan Shu was offered a promotion to General of the Rear. Yuan Shu rejected this offer and fled this capital to Nanyang, probably due to Dong Zhuo’s poisoning of Emperor Liu Bian and Empress He, making him deeply unpopular in gentry clans.

## In Fair Nanyang

Acting on this distaste for Dong Zhuo, the new imperial “protector”, Yuan Shu joined the Coalition of the East Pass which was headed by Yuan Shao who was no longer just the son of a maid since he was adopted their uncle, Yuan Cheng. This infuriated Yuan Shu, who’s mother was now held in higher regard than a concubine of Yuan Feng. Upon Yuan Cheng’s death, Yuan Shao inherited the title of Second Marquis and became the head of a branch of the family. In contrast Yuan Shu was left with just being the second born son as Yuan Ji inherited all of Yuan Feng’s titles. However, Yuan Shu was blessed with the merits of the men by his side, namely Sun Jian. Although strange at first glance, at this point Sun Jian held the title of Administrator of Changsha after serving years in the military. He was the third born son of a melon farmer and if his sons, Sun Quan and Sun Ce, had not found the Kingdom of Wu then Sun Jian’s legacy would have been limited to just being a general of Yuan Shu, who had a terrible military record. Sun Jian’s first task under Yuan Shu would be to kill Zhang Zi, the Administrator of Nanyang and a Dong Zhuo loyalist. Sun Jian tricked Zhang Zi into attending a dinner at his military encampment before detaining him as a hostage. Zhang Zi was then framed for crimes and punished with execution; the whole thing was a masterful operation. Thus, Yuan Shu seized control Nanyang and made it his main cantonment; this was a huge step in feeding Yuan Shu the ambition he had since Nanyang was one of the most populated commanderies but, perhaps more importantly, it was also spared from the Yellow Turban Rebellion which made it substantially wealthier than it would have otherwise been. Yuan Shu also named Sun Jian as the General Who Breaks the Enemy and Prefect of the Yu Province in recognition of his merits. It is important to note that Yuan Shu had effectively no authority in Dong Zhuo’s court to grant these titles but that was okay, since if the Coalition of the East won over Dong Zhuo, he could easily grant both.

</div>

In response to the power grab, Dong Zhuo sent Hu Zhen to deal with Yuan Shu’s dissenter faction at Ruyang, Nanyang. Hu Zhen expected little resistance and arrived seeing Sun Jian’s farewell feast for his logistics officer which was held outside the encampment. As Sun Jian watched the horizon slowly fill out with ranks of soldiers he calmly continued the banquet and asked his officers to slowly filter back to camp and prepare men. Seeing this strange display of composure, Hu Zhen hesitated and stalled, losing the opportunity to attack the now prepared camp. The “Battle of Ruyang” ended as Hu Zhen retreated, with no way of fulfilling his body quota. Following subsequent military ventures, Sun Jian gained fame across China and was even offered a political marriage and a blank cheque for any government post by Dong Zhuo. Not the biggest fan of the big guy, Sun Jian resumed his march and headed for the now abandoned capital, Luoyang. However, jealous of Sun Jian’s fame and popularity, Yuan Shu decided to cut off Sun Jian’s supplies to prevent him from seizing even more military glory. It is important to note that although Luoyang was burnt down during the massacre, it still held a vast amount of prestige and possession of the capital was still highly coveted by regional warlords at this time. Sun Jian was forced to convince Yuan Shu of his continued loyalty and the need for his support in order to retake Luoyang from Lu Bu. The Coalition of the East Pass finally had a material achievement in their rebellion against Dong Zhuo’s centralised government; however, it was all too little too late and the coalition was already torn apart by the warlords’ own regional interests. No longer interested in taking down Dong Zhuo, the coalition was over by the end of 191. Even worse, Sun Jian also recovered an imperial jade seal from Luoyang. Not letting this object of legitimacy slip by, Yuan Shu held Sun Jian’s lady hostage and demanded the seal which Sun Jian turned over. 

## One Step Forward… Two Steps Back
Yuan Shu now had two things to support his legitimacy as an Emperor: control of the capital, and an imperial seal; which also carried the Mandate of Heaven. It was around this time that Yuan Shu seriously started considering his dream of the Zhong-Shi Dynasty; however, the actual Han Dynasty Emperor Liu Xie was still alive (Dong Zhuo decided to kill off the older Liu Bian in similar logic to the eunuchs) and soon things would go slightly pear shaped. Although Nanyang was a wealthy commandery, Yuan Shu was left in an incredibly precarious position given the tattered state of the coalition. To the east lay the powerful Gentleman of the Han, Liu Biao, and to the west the cunning Cao Cao. Luckily for him Yuan Shao was buried away in the northern most parts of China, far away enough so that the two would struggle to maintain supply lines in a war. Regardless, the very ground that Yuan Shu stood on was subject to siege at any given moment and, knowing this, he acted fast. He allied with Yuan Shao’s northern rival, Gongsun Zan, and in response Yuan Shao allied with Liu Biao: the rivalry between the two siblings had never and could not have been worse. In an effort to diminish Yuan Shao’s influence, Yuan Shu sent Sun Jian to Xiangyang with orders to attack Liu Biao. 

<div class="image">

    <em>Qing Dynasty illustration of the Battle of Xiangyang, Sun Jian's forces are on the left and Liu Biao's are on the right</em>
</div>

In the initial skirmish, Sun Jian faced off against Liu Biao’s general, Huang Zu, and came out on top before surrounding the city and preparing siege weapons. Liu Biao sent Huang Zu out again, this time to muster reinforcements from the south. However, on his return journey Sun Jian led a charge against the forces and routed Huang Zu’s forces, once again, who took refuge in the mountains. Riding the momentum and hoping to destroy Liu Biao’s ability to defend the settlement, Sun Jian pursued Huang Zu’s forces into the forested mountains where he was ambushed and cut down by a hail of arrows. With Sun Jian dead, Yuan Shu was beaten by Liu Biao whose forces quickly managed to cut off all supply lines into Nanyang. When studying Yuan Shu’s policies it is important to look into his character. Here was a man who was deeply envious of others; ambitious; cruel; and decadent. Under Yuan Shu, the once prosperous Nanyang was plundered poor and drained so dry that by the time it came under siege from Liu Biao’s forces there were no reserves left. Thus, abandoned Nanyang and fled eastwards where he would look to expand into Cao Cao’s territory in the Yan Province. In 192, Yuan Shu turned a blind eye to past alliances and joined forces with the central government, now run by Li Jue after the assassination of Dong Zhuo, whilst marching towards the Cao Cao’s encampments. The force also consisted of some Southern Xiongnu tribes and Blackmountain Bandits. Upon arrival in Yan Province, Yuan Shu sent one of his generals to make a forward camp. However, before the camp could be finished Cao Cao crushed the general’s forces with about 30000 men. Yuan Shu ordered the combined forces to march on Cao Cao but was defeated as many of the bandits and tribesmen fled when it was apparent that the prospects of victory were slim at best. 

In the next three months Yuan Shu suffered repeated defeats and retreated roughly 700km as Cao Cao pursued him through Fengqiu, Xiangyu, Taishou, and Ningling before allowing Yuan Shu to settle in Jiujiang. Yuan Shu was ultimately saved by Cao Cao’s urgency in another conflict with Tao Qian as the latter was accused of ordering the murder of Cao Cao’s father. Disgraced and demoralised, Yuan Shu gave up the idea of fighting back, decided to just restart his efforts where he was and, similarly to how he took control of Nanyang, launched a surprise attack on the Prefect of the Yang Province, Chen Wen. Yuan Shu then named himself as the new Prefect of the Yang Province as well as Marquis of Xu Zhou and Duke of Yang Zhai. Funnily enough Li Jue didn’t mind this and confirmed Yuan Shu as Prefect of the Yang Province. The southern part of the Yang Province was largely in rebellion and a semi autonomous region where the central government’s influence was severely limited; nonetheless, it gave Yuan Shu the whiff of legitimacy he so desperately needed to fuel the flames of ambition and to continue with his pursuit of establishing his dynasty. With the official mandate of residence: he cemented his grip in the north of the province and even managed to claim a bit of Tao Qian’s land since Cao Cao was winning the war handedly.  

## Yuan and Yang
The Yang province had a few commanderies which would be key to Yuan Shu’s hegemony over the area. Of course his influence was initially concentrated in the place of his arrival, Jiu Jiang, but he would need to reign in the whole region to support his claims of legitimacy. Lu Jiang was governed by the senior statesman Lu Kang who had deep ties within the south. Lu Kang did not recognise Lu Jie’s or Yuan Shu’s court as legitimate and disregarded Yuan Shu’s commands as Prefect. In Yu Zhang Liu Biao had appointed an administrator to compete with the central government’s assigned administrator as an attempt to take control of the commandery. Neither side had reasonable control of the commandery which was effectively run by bandits and the gentry. Dan Yang and Wu were both brought into the fold by Yuan family ties to the Sun and Wu clan. Sun Jian’s brother in law, Wu Jin, was the Administrator of Dan Yang and an old lieutenant of Sun Jian, Zhu Zhi, became the Administrator of Wu. Unfortunately, Yuan Shu’s influence was stretched thin in the southern commandery of Kuai Ji which was run by Wang Lang, a famous scholar who also disregarded both Li Jue and Yuan Shu’s claims over the region. Despite political opposition to the west and from the south, neither Lu Kang or Wang Lang decided to attack and dislodge Yuan Shu from the region.

</div>

Thus, Yuan Shu was able to rest and recoup his strength. In 194 he also acquired the services of Sun Jian’s son, Sun Ce. It is common belief that Yuan Shu did not treat the Sun clan as generously as he could have, namely Sun Ce by citing Yuan Shu reneging on his promise to appoint Sun Ce as Administrator of Jiu Jiang following their war with Liu Bei. The position was ultimately awarded to a man named Chen Ji. However, there are arguments that can be made for Yuan Shu not granting the title. Firstly, Sun Ce was barely 19 at the time and had little to no experience in war or statesmanship; thus, it would not have been strange to see Sun Ce perform inefficiently and ineffectively in his new role. Secondly, granting Sun Ce such a high ranking title based only on his lineage would have certainly upset other courtiers and weakened Yuan Shu’s claims to legitimacy. Thirdly, the Sun clan already held an arguably absurd amount of influence within the Yuan Shu’s court which would have endangered them should Yuan Shu hold suspicions. Just to quickly address the Sun clan’s influence in the region: 

- Administrator of Dan Yang, Wu Jing, was Sun Ce’s uncle
- Administrator of Wu, Zhu Zhi, was one of Sun Jian’s officers
- Administrator of Guang Ling, Sun Ben, was also one of Sun Jian’s officers 

Evidently a large amount of the land was run by the Sun clan, if Yuan Shu appointed Sun Ce as the Administrator of Jiu Jiang, he would effectively be giving over ownership of his commanderies to Sun Ce who was the de facto head of the Sun clan.

Just as commonly cited is Yuan Shu’s promise to award Sun Ce with the position of Administrator of Lu Jiang, if he could assist Yuan Shu in removing Lu Kang who refused to supply Yuan Shu’s army during their war with Liu Bei. Of course, the 70 year old Lu Kang had no obligation to assist Yuan Shu in an offensive war against another governor but Yuan Shu didn’t take rejection well and tasked Sun Ce with Lu Kang’s dispatch in hopes of similar successes that Sun Jian brought him in the murder of Zhang Zi. To Yuan Shu’s disappointment, Sun Ce took two years to capture the settlement. Not quite the performance that Sun Jian’s son could be expected of and thus the title of administrator was never offered. The little conqueror quickly made up for himself as, handed only 1000 men and a few horses, he destroyed the forces of Liu Yao to regain control of Dan Yang; strengthened Yuan Shu’s influence in the south by beating Wang Lang in Kuai Ji; and forced many of the dissenting factions (both government forces and bandits) into Yu Zhang. By 197, Yuan Shu’s territory now consisted of all commanderies of the Yang province as well as the Guang Ling province.

Yuan Shu also had his issues elsewhere dealt with as to the north Liu Bei, Cao Cao, and Lü Bu were all in a standoff and Yuan Shao was busy contesting Gongsun Zan. His only immediate resistance was met on the western borders as Liu Biao was not engaged in any conflict. For this blip of a moment, Yuan Shu was the most powerful warlord in China and could freely focus on matters of political ambition once more. 

## Declaring Intentions

At this point, Yuan Shu had not addressed the fact that Emperor Liu Xie was still alive and fell into the hands of Cao Cao, but that didn’t really matter to Yuan Shu. To him he carried an imperial seal and thus, the mandate of heaven. To push matters further, a travelling fortune teller told Yuan Shu that his family was linked to the mythical Emperor Yao who was often associated with the cosmic phrase of earth. To the fortune teller it was only natural that Yuan Shu’s lineage would succeed the Han, who was associated with fire and thus would give way to earth according to the philosophy of Wuxing. He advised Yuan Shu to change the calendar name to Zhong Jia. Although changing the calendar name may not seem like much, it did mean a lot at the time. The emperor would name the calendar with two characters upon ascending and time would be tracked by adding years the emperor had been in power to the name of the calendar. The emperor could also change the name whenever he wished but that would indicate that something drastic had changed to the empire. Anyways, armed with granny science and government legitimacy propaganda, Yuan Shu decided to name a calendar as Zhong Jia, meaning second clan i.e. the second most powerful clan following the Emperor Liu Xie’s clan who would supposedly fade into nothingness. Having acted as an Emperor by naming a calendar, Yuan Shu then decided to fully play the part: building palaces, gathering concubines, and flaunting the imperial seal. This self promotion to the highest post did not see any betterment in Yuan Shu’s character as he continued to be overly decadent and arrogant and ran his land as a powermonger. Many of his courtiers, including Sun Ce, defected out of disgust. An important detail to note is that Yuan Shu never formally declared himself emperor; but through his actions, every warlord in China understood his intentions and once Yuan Shu was marked as an Enemy of the Han, everyone decided to turn against him. After being pursued through China by Cao Cao, Liu Bei, and Lü Bu; Yuan Shu attempted to flee to the north to form an alliance with Yuan Shao. However, the Yuan brothers would never get to repair their bitter rivalry as Yuan Shu’s forces were blocked on the way and he was forced to retreat to Shouchun. Yuan Shu’s final request for a glass of honey water was unfulfilled as he died of starvation in 199, his ostentatious appetite making it impossible for him to swallow the coarse food of his soldiers. The story of Yuan Shu is one where the climax is very short; he spent most of his life accumulating prestige and legitimacy, when he finally had his moment he was the false emperor of Zhong for only two years. For the rest of the Three Kingdoms Period, no character attempted anything near as audacious or reckless as Yuan Shu. Despite big dreams and ambition, Yuan Shu’s legacy fell drastically short. His children fared much better than he did and later on, his daughter, Lady Yuan, became a concubine of the Sun clan and was offered the title of Empress in 238 but refused. His son, Yuan Yao, would become a court advisor at Wu. In retrospect: Yuan Shu’s inability to swallow the low grade food and request for honey water is poetic justice. Even on the death bed, the ever pretentious Yuan Shu could not afford to disgrace himself and it really begs the question of what he could have achieved in his lifetime had he not been so proud and egocentric.
