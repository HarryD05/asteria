This summer I have been working on a Data Science Project, reviewing the exact total hours and minutes I spent doing activities ranging from sleeping to revising to taking public transport. I built a python script to find this information from a precise journal I've kept for over a year, detailing not only the time I would start and stop doing something, but also the people I would do it with and the places I would do it at. 

The first half of the video focuses on how I went about designing the process and implementing the code to extract the data from the text file I used as a record, and the second half features my review and commentary on the results the program found.
