Hi, I'm Jim and I write about things I like best in literature. I'm always down to read something weird and I'm also a huge nerd (if you haven't gathered that already) so I'm probably talking about Magic: The Gathering, DnD or some random novel at any given time. I hope you have as much fun reading my articles as I had writing them!
