Music has been a passion of mine for years. I play multiple instruments such as guitar, piano, bass and ukelele, but Ive been playing my main instrument - drums - for 5 years. Recently, Ive been getting into jazz druming in particular which is the style I play in the performance of “Night in Tunisia”.
