Hi! I'm Mudit, a coordinator and designer for Asteria â€“ that means I split my time evenly between working with every Adobe program under the sun and stopping Ram from making bad decisions.

I'm looking to study Computer Science at university, likely followed by a career in software engineering. I am also interested in linguistics, progressive politics, and sociology.

## A-Level Subjects

- Computer Science
