Hi! I'm Yash, singing for Asteria. Music is one of my biggest interests, and on top of singing, I play the piano and violin.

I also love maths, and plan on studying it at university, whilst maybe trying to pursue some sort of career in music. God knows where the future will take me, and all of us for that matter.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy the performances I am a part of! Apologies in advance, there's probably a voice crack in there somewhere.
