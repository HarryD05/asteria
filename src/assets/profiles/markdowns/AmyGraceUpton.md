Hi! I'm Amy Grace (or Qian Yi if you want to attempt my Chinese name) and I write about things that impact myself and others around me, but perhaps aren't as widely addressed and they could/should be. Currently looking to study Law, and later pursue a career in Criminal and/or Human Rights Law :) Passionate and prone to ranting and/or nerding out about whatever happens to have taken a hold of my attention at the time :) For those who didn't guess that I am mixed-race, I am of Chinese and white ancestry :)
