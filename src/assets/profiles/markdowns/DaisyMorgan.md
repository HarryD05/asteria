I'm the Mathematics editor, but I'm interested in Biology, Chemistry and Maths and looking to combine all three at university through studying Natural Sciences. Previously, I've attended mathematical and biological workshops at the Royal Institution, won a Cambridge Science Society essay competition on microbes and generally just like staying up to date with new advancements! Outside of school I'm quite sporty - I like going to the gym, playing football, running and I am a swimming teacher. I also just relaxing through baking, reading and knitting!
