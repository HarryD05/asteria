Hey, Iâ€™m Sean.

I love studying and performing music, and play a wide variety of instruments which I very much enjoy. I also study Computer Science, Maths and Further Maths, hoping to go on to study Computer Science (of some sort!) at university. 

I also love sports, basketball in particular, which I play in my free time (alongside music) but also competitively. I hope to be able to do something with this in the future as well.

## A-Level Subjects
- Computer Science
- Mathematics
- Further mathematics
- Music
