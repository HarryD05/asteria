Hi! 

I'm Antonio, writing about music for Asteria (and hopefully econ soon!). I'm interested in the big optimisation problem of microeconomics and hope to study Bsc Economics. I also look forward to pursuing my musical education at a conservatoire. 

My dream is to play in a concert hall for a large audience; until then I will continue to spend my free time practising, studying, and sleeping. 

Also, I have 7 birds and they're all really cute.
