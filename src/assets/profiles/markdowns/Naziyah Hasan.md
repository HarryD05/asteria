As a Year 12 student keen on pursuing medicine, delving deeper into the different conditions and diseases has always been a passionate hobby. The complexity and the simultaneous processes that occur in the human body has always fascinated me. Apart from the academics, I am a professional table tennis player who enjoys painting and preserving flower petals!
