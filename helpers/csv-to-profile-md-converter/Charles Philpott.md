What is life if not to critique? Why live in a world where we take everything for granted? Whether it be staring at you in the face, or lurking in the shadows, society needs - no, it deserves - to be analysed. From the most basic principles to the vast expanses of sociological systems, I aim to help you get to grips with why the world motors eternally onwards. When considering artistic elitism, political plots and psychological scams, nothing is safe from the Eye of the Critic. So, care to unravel the world?
